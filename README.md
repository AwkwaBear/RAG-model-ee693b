# RAG Model Evaluation

This project was developed for a graduate course on LLMs. The notebook modifies a hugging face template to have Claude, Zephyr, and ChatGPT to each answer questions using RAG (Retreival Augmented Generation) to assist in answer context.

The answers are then judged by the other models to evaluate which models do better than others and also evaluate if a certain model grades more harshly than the others as the roles are rotated.

The final paper is here below.
