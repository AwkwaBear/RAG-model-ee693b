# RAG Model Evaluation

This project was developed for a graduate course on LLMs. The notebook modifies a hugging face template to have Claude, Zephyr, and ChatGPT to each answer questions using RAG (Retreival Augmented Generation) to assist in answer context. Models are interfaced with using Langchain.

The answers are then judged by the other models to evaluate which models do better than others and also evaluate if a certain model grades more harshly than the others as the roles are rotated.


This project was completed for a graduate special topics course on artificial intelligence at University of Hawaii at Manoa.

The final paper is here below.
