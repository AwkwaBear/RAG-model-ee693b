In an imbalanced dataset this is not the case: in fraud detection for example there are usually many more non-fraud cases than fraud cases in the dataset.", "|        | [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ajaykarthick/imdb-movie-reviews/discussions/1)                                             | [ajaykarthick/imdb-movie-reviews](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ajaykarthick/imdb-movie-reviews)                                                                 | 222       | 1     |\n|        |                                                                                                                                   | [MMInstruction/M3IT-80](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMInstruction/M3IT-80)                                                                                     | 108       | 1     |", "## The dataset[[the-dataset]]\n\nTo showcase domain adaptation, we'll use the famous [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) (or IMDb for short), which is a corpus of movie reviews that is often used to benchmark sentiment analysis models. By fine-tuning DistilBERT on this corpus, we expect the language model will adapt its vocabulary from the factual data of Wikipedia that it was pretrained on to the more subjective elements of movie reviews. We can get the data from the Hugging Face Hub with the `load_dataset()` function from \ud83e\udd17 Datasets:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nimdb_dataset = load_dataset(\"imdb\")\nimdb_dataset\n```", "Predicted answer: COUNT > 69\nWhat is the total number of movies?\nPredicted answer: SUM > 87, 53, 69\n```\n</pt>\n<tf>\nHere we explain how you can use [`TFTapasForQuestionAnswering`] for inference (i.e. making predictions on new data). For inference, only `input_ids`, `attention_mask` and `token_type_ids` (which you can obtain using [`TapasTokenizer`]) have to be provided to the model to obtain the logits. Next, you can use the handy [`~models.tapas.tokenization_tapas.convert_logits_to_predictions`] method to convert these into predicted coordinates and optional aggregation indices.", "These large datasets experience similar issues to those found in text-to-image datasets. The most commonly used text-video dataset, [WebVid](https://m-bain.github.io/webvid-dataset/), consists of 10.7 million pairs of text-video pairs (52K video hours) and contains a fair amount of noisy samples with irrelevant video descriptions.

Load the processor from the pretrained model for the target language. You can use the `AutoProcessor` class from the `transformers` library to load the processor. For example, to load the processor for French, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   from transformers import AutoProcessor\n\n   processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mms-1b-all\", target_lang=\"fra\")\n   ```\n\n2. Set the target language for the tokenizer. You can use the `set_target_lang` method of the `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer` class to set the target language. For example, to set the target language for French, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   from transformers import Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer\n\n   tokenizer = Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mms-1b-all\", target_lang=\"fra\")\n   tokenizer.set_target_lang(\"fra\")\n   ```\n\n3. Load the adapter for the target language. You can use the `load_adapter` method of the `Wav2Vec2ForCTC` class to load the adapter for the target language. For example, to load the adapter for French, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC\n\n   model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mms-1b-all\")\n   model.load_adapter(\"fra\")\n   ```\n\n4. Process the audio or text input using the loaded processor. You can use the `processor` object to process the input. For example, to process an audio sample in French, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   audio_inputs = processor(fr_sample, sampling_rate=16_000, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can use the processor to process audio or text input in a language other than English.", "retrieved_docs": ["#### Loading\n\nBy default MMS loads adapter weights for English.

Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nclass MyTool(gr.GradiTool):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__(title=\"My Tool\")\n\n    def _block_input(self, gr):\n        self.textbox = gr.Textbox(lines=2, visible=True)\n\n    def _block_output(self, gr):\n        return [self.textbox]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_tool = MyTool()\n    my_tool.launch()\n```\n\nIn this example, we're creating a custom tool called `MyTool` that inherits from `gr.GradiTool`.

You can pass a list of adapter names to activate multiple adapters simultaneously.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom adapter_transformers import PeftModel, PeftConfig\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\n\n# Load the base model\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n# Load adapter 1 from the Hub\nadapter_1_name = model.load_adapter(\"AdapterHub/bert-base-uncased-pf-imdb\", source=\"hf\")\n\n# Load adapter 2 from a local directory\nadapter_2_path = \"path/to/adapter2.bin\"\nadapter_2_name = model.load_adapter(adapter_2_path)\n\n# Set the active adapter weights\nmodel.set_adapter([\"adapter_1\", \"adapter_2\"])\n```\n\nIn this example, we load two adapters - one from the HF Hub and the other from a local directory.

The range of the perplexity metric is from 0 to infinity, where a score of 0 indicates perfect prediction and a score of infinity indicates complete uncertainty.

To do so, we should pass a to define a `compute_metrics` function to the `Trainer` which is then called at each validation step during training.Document 1:::\n. The main thing to know here is that it can be a real pain to implement yourself, but DataCollatorForLanguageModeling will do it for you. And that's it! That covers the most commonly used data collators and the tasks they're used for.Document 2:::\n. But for other workflows, data collators can be more complex, as they handle some of the preprocessing needed for that particular task. For PyTorch users, you usually pass the DataCollator to your Trainer object. In TensorFlow, the easiest way to use a DataCollator is to pass it to the to_tf_dataset method of your dataset. You'll see these approaches used in the examples and notebooks throughout this course. In both cases, you end up with an iterable that's going to output collated batches, ready for trainingDocument 3:::\nHowever, we saw that `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` also applies random masking with each evaluation, so we'll see some fluctuations in our perplexity scores with each training run. One way to eliminate this source of randomness is to apply the masking _once_ on the whole test set, and then use the default data collator in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers to collect the batches during evaluation. To see how this works, let's implement a simple function that applies the masking on a batch, similar to our first encounter with `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`:Document 4:::\n. Those gradients are then used by the optimizer to update the model weights and make them a little bit better. We then repeat the process with a new batch of training data. If any of this is unclear, don't hesitate to take a refresher on your favorite deep learning course. We will use the GLUE MRPC dataset here again, and we have seen how to preprocess the data using the Datasets library with dynamic padding. Checkout the videos linked below if you haven't seen them already. With this done, we only have to define PyTorch DataLoaders, which will be responsible to convert the elements of our dataset into batches. We use our DataCollatorForPadding as the collate function, and shuffle the training setDocument 5:::\nn a lot of our examples, you're going to see DataCollators popping up over and over. They're used in both PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows, and maybe even in JAX, but no-one really knows what's happening in JAX. We have a research team working on that, so maybe they'll tell us soon. But what are data collators? Data collators collate data. More specifically, they put together a list of samples into a single training minibatch. For some tasks, the data collator can be very straightforward. For example, when you're doing sequence classification, all you really need from your data collator is that it pads your samples to the same length and concatenates them into a single TensorDocument 6:::\n. These are DefaultDataCollator and DataCollatorWithPadding. These are the ones you should use if your labels are straightforward and your data doesn't need any special processing before being ready for training. Most sequence classification tasks, for example, would use one of these data collators. Remember that because different models have different padding tokens, DataCollatorWithPadding will need your model's Tokenizer so it knows how to pad sequences properly! So how do you choose one of these? Simple: As you can see here, if you have variable sequence lengths then you should use DataCollatorWithPadding, which will pad all your sequences to the same length\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is the main function of DataCollators in machine learning?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nThe main function of DataCollators in machine learning is to collate a list of samples into a single training minibatch. Specifically, DataCollators pad the samples to the same length and concatenate them into a single Tensor. This is important during training to ensure that each batch is correctly padded, as training samples are reshuffled before each epoch. DataCollators also handle preprocessing needed for specific tasks, making them more complex for some workflows. They are used in both PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows and are responsible for making sure each batch is correctly padded during training, as well as monitoring the performance of the model on a held-out validation set during training. The choice between different types of DataCollators depends on the specific task and whether the labels are straightforward and the data doesn't need any special processing before being ready for training.", "retrieved_docs": ["Next, we load a data collator. A [data collator](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/data_collator) is responsible for making sure each batch is correctly padded during training, which should happen dynamically since training samples are reshuffled before each epoch.\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding\n\ndata_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)\n```\n\n\nDuring training, it is important to monitor the performance of the model on a held-out validation set. To do so, we should pass a to define a `compute_metrics` function to the `Trainer` which is then called at each validation step during training.", ". The main thing to know here is that it can be a real pain to implement yourself, but DataCollatorForLanguageModeling will do it for you. And that's it! That covers the most commonly used data collators and the tasks they're used for.", ". But for other workflows, data collators can be more complex, as they handle some of the preprocessing needed for that particular task. For PyTorch users, you usually pass the DataCollator to your Trainer object. In TensorFlow, the easiest way to use a DataCollator is to pass it to the to_tf_dataset method of your dataset. You'll see these approaches used in the examples and notebooks throughout this course. In both cases, you end up with an iterable that's going to output collated batches, ready for training", "However, we saw that `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` also applies random masking with each evaluation, so we'll see some fluctuations in our perplexity scores with each training run. One way to eliminate this source of randomness is to apply the masking _once_ on the whole test set, and then use the default data collator in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers to collect the batches during evaluation. To see how this works, let's implement a simple function that applies the masking on a batch, similar to our first encounter with `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`:", ". Those gradients are then used by the optimizer to update the model weights and make them a little bit better. We then repeat the process with a new batch of training data. If any of this is unclear, don't hesitate to take a refresher on your favorite deep learning course. We will use the GLUE MRPC dataset here again, and we have seen how to preprocess the data using the Datasets library with dynamic padding. Checkout the videos linked below if you haven't seen them already. With this done, we only have to define PyTorch DataLoaders, which will be responsible to convert the elements of our dataset into batches. We use our DataCollatorForPadding as the collate function, and shuffle the training set", "n a lot of our examples, you're going to see DataCollators popping up over and over. They're used in both PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows, and maybe even in JAX, but no-one really knows what's happening in JAX. We have a research team working on that, so maybe they'll tell us soon. But what are data collators? Data collators collate data. More specifically, they put together a list of samples into a single training minibatch. For some tasks, the data collator can be very straightforward. For example, when you're doing sequence classification, all you really need from your data collator is that it pads your samples to the same length and concatenates them into a single Tensor", ". These are DefaultDataCollator and DataCollatorWithPadding. These are the ones you should use if your labels are straightforward and your data doesn't need any special processing before being ready for training. Most sequence classification tasks, for example, would use one of these data collators. Remember that because different models have different padding tokens, DataCollatorWithPadding will need your model's Tokenizer so it knows how to pad sequences properly! So how do you choose one of these? Simple: As you can see here, if you have variable sequence lengths then you should use DataCollatorWithPadding, which will pad all your sequences to the same length"], "test_settings": "reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta_rerank:True_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_chunk:200", "eval_score_Claude-3-Sonnet": "5\nFeedback: The response accurately describes the main function of DataCollators in machine learning, which is collating a list of samples into a single training minibatch by padding samples to the same length and concatenating them into a single tensor.

They can then be concatenated, hence the final preprocessed input is a tensor of shape (batch_size, 50176 + 1920 + 1, 704) = (batch_size, 52097, 704).Document 1:::\nThe preprocessor (with the settings defined above) will first concatenate the frames along the channel dimension, leading to a tensor of shape (batch_size, 368, 496, 54) - assuming one also moves the channel dimension to be last.

Next, the spatial dimensions are flattened, leading to a tensor of shape (batch_size, 368*496, 54) = (batch_size, 182528, 54).

After this operation, the Perceiver encoder employs a (repeatable) block of self-attention layers to update the embeddings of the latents. The encoder will finally produce a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_latents, d_latents), containing the last hidden states of the latentsDocument 3:::\nAfter this, Perceiver IO applies cross-attention between the latents (which produce queries) of shape (batch_size, 256, 1280) and the preprocessed inputs (which produce keys and values) of shape (batch_size, 2048, 768). The output of this initial cross-attention operation is a tensor that has the same shape as the queries (which are the latents, in this case).

These steps\ninclude but are not limited to resizing, normalizing, color channel correction, and converting images to tensors.\n\n<Tip>\n\nImage preprocessing often follows some form of image augmentation. Both image preprocessing and image augmentation\ntransform image data, but they serve different purposes:Document 5:::\nIn the Perceiver IO paper, one uses 256 latents, and sets the dimensionality of the latents to 1280. If one also adds a batch dimension, the Perceiver has latents of shape (batch_size, 256, 1280). First, the preprocessor (which one provides at initialization) will take care of embedding the UTF-8 byte IDs to embedding vectors. Hence, `PerceiverTextPreprocessor` will turn the `inputs` of shape (batch_size, 2048) to a tensor of shape (batch_size, 2048, 768) - assuming that each byte ID is turned into a vector of size 768 (this is determined by the `d_model` attribute of `PerceiverConfig`).Document 6:::\nSince `inputs` is a dictionary with our usual keys (input IDs, attention mask, etc.), the last step is to define the preprocessing function we will apply on the datasets:\n\n```python\nmax_length = 128\n\n\ndef preprocess_function(examples):\n    inputs = [ex[\"en\"] for ex in examples[\"translation\"]]\n    targets = [ex[\"fr\"] for ex in examples[\"translation\"]]\n    model_inputs = tokenizer(\n        inputs, text_target=targets, max_length=max_length, truncation=True\n    )\n    return model_inputs\n```\n\nNote that we set the same maximum length for our inputs and outputs.

In Document 5, the preprocessor embeds the UTF-8 byte IDs to embedding vectors, resulting in a tensor of shape (batch_size, 2048, 768). Therefore, the final preprocessed input for the Perceiver TextPreprocessor would have a shape of (batch_size, 2048, 768) after embedding the input IDs.\n\nAnswer: The shape of the final preprocessed input for the Perceiver TextPreprocessor is (batch_size, 2048, 768).\n\nSource document: Document 5.", "retrieved_docs": ["Next, `PerceiverMultimodalPreprocessor` will pad the preprocessed modalities with modality-specific trainable embeddings to make concatenation along the time dimension possible. In this case, the modality with the highest channel dimension is the class label (it has 700 channels). The authors enforce a minimum padding size of 4, hence each modality will be padded to have 704 channels. They can then be concatenated, hence the final preprocessed input is a tensor of shape (batch_size, 50176 + 1920 + 1, 704) = (batch_size, 52097, 704).", "The preprocessor (with the settings defined above) will first concatenate the frames along the channel dimension, leading to a tensor of shape (batch_size, 368, 496, 54) - assuming one also moves the channel dimension to be last. The authors explain in their paper (page 8) why concatenation along the channel dimension makes sense. Next, the spatial dimensions are flattened, leading to a tensor of shape (batch_size, 368*496, 54) = (batch_size, 182528, 54). Then, position embeddings (each of which have dimensionality 258) are concatenated, leading to a final preprocessed input of shape (batch_size, 182528, 322). These will be used to perform cross-attention with the latents.", "In other words, the `inputs` (which could be any modality, or a combination thereof) are first optionally preprocessed using a `preprocessor`. Next, the preprocessed inputs perform a cross-attention operation with the latent variables of the Perceiver encoder. In this operation, the latent variables produce queries (Q), while the preprocessed inputs produce keys and values (KV). After this operation, the Perceiver encoder employs a (repeatable) block of self-attention layers to update the embeddings of the latents. The encoder will finally produce a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_latents, d_latents), containing the last hidden states of the latents", "After this, Perceiver IO applies cross-attention between the latents (which produce queries) of shape (batch_size, 256, 1280) and the preprocessed inputs (which produce keys and values) of shape (batch_size, 2048, 768). The output of this initial cross-attention operation is a tensor that has the same shape as the queries (which are the latents, in this case). In other words, the output of the cross-attention operation is of shape (batch_size, 256, 1280).", "```py\n>>> processed_dataset[\"input_values\"][0].shape\n(100000,)\n\n>>> processed_dataset[\"input_values\"][1].shape\n(100000,)\n```\n\n## Computer vision\n\nFor computer vision tasks, you'll need an [image processor](main_classes/image_processor) to prepare your dataset for the model.\nImage preprocessing consists of several steps that convert images into the input expected by the model. These steps\ninclude but are not limited to resizing, normalizing, color channel correction, and converting images to tensors.\n\n<Tip>\n\nImage preprocessing often follows some form of image augmentation. Both image preprocessing and image augmentation\ntransform image data, but they serve different purposes:", "In the Perceiver IO paper, one uses 256 latents, and sets the dimensionality of the latents to 1280. If one also adds a batch dimension, the Perceiver has latents of shape (batch_size, 256, 1280). First, the preprocessor (which one provides at initialization) will take care of embedding the UTF-8 byte IDs to embedding vectors. Hence, `PerceiverTextPreprocessor` will turn the `inputs` of shape (batch_size, 2048) to a tensor of shape (batch_size, 2048, 768) - assuming that each byte ID is turned into a vector of size 768 (this is determined by the `d_model` attribute of `PerceiverConfig`).", "Since `inputs` is a dictionary with our usual keys (input IDs, attention mask, etc.), the last step is to define the preprocessing function we will apply on the datasets:\n\n```python\nmax_length = 128\n\n\ndef preprocess_function(examples):\n    inputs = [ex[\"en\"] for ex in examples[\"translation\"]]\n    targets = [ex[\"fr\"] for ex in examples[\"translation\"]]\n    model_inputs = tokenizer(\n        inputs, text_target=targets, max_length=max_length, truncation=True\n    )\n    return model_inputs\n```\n\nNote that we set the same maximum length for our inputs and outputs.

Specifically, the paper \"Seamless: Multilingual Expressive and Streaming Speech Translation\" by the Seamless Communication team from Meta AI, which proposes SeamlessM4T-v2, describes the differences in detail (refer to Document 3). However, Document 4 mentions that the release of SeamlessM4T-v1 is the \"version 1\" release of the model, and for the updated \"version 2\" release, we should refer to the SeamlessM4T-v2 docs (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/seamless_m4t_v2). Therefore, to answer the question, we need to compare the second-pass model of SeamlessM4T-v1 and SeamlessM4T-v2. Unfortunately, Document 5 only mentions that SeamlessM4T features a versatile architecture that smoothly handles the sequential generation of text and speech, and it comprises two sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. It does not provide any specific details about the second-pass model. However, Document 6 suggests that we can use `return_intermediate_token_ids=True` with `SeamlessM4TModel` to return both speech and text simultaneously. This implies that the second-pass model in SeamlessM4T-v2 may generate speech tokens from the translated text, whereas the second-pass model in SeamlessM4T-v1 may have a different function. Without further information, it is unclear what the exact differences are between the second-pass models of SeamlessM4T-v1 and SeamlessM4T-v2.

The Trainer class take your datasets, your model as well as the training hyperparameters and can perform the training on any kind of setup (CPU, GPU, multi GPUs, TPUs). It can also compute the predictions on any dataset, and if you provided metrics, evaluate your model on any dataset. It can also handle final data-processing such as dynamic padding as long as you provide the tokenizer or a given data collator.

Create the desired model with the `features_only` argument set to `True`:\n\n   ```python\n   model = timm.create_model('resnet18', features_only=True, pretrained=True)\n   ```\n\n   This will create a model that only outputs feature maps and does not have a final classification head.\n\n3.

An important difference between classical methods like ARIMA and novel deep learning methods is the following.\n\n##  Probabilistic ForecastingDocument 1:::\nSome classical methods are point-valued (meaning, they just output a single value per time step) and models are trained by minimizing an L2 or L1 type of loss with respect to the ground truth data. However, since forecasts are often used in some real-world decision making pipeline, even with humans in the loop, it is much more beneficial to provide the uncertainties of predictions. This is also called \"probabilistic forecasting\", as opposed to \"point forecasting\". This entails modeling a probabilistic distribution, from which one can sample.\n\nSo in short, rather than training local point forecasting models, we hope to train **global probabilistic** models. Deep learning is a great fit for this, as neural networks can learn representations from several related time series as well as model the uncertainty of the data.Document 2:::\n##  Probabilistic Forecasting\n\nTypically, classical methods are fitted on each time series in a dataset individually. These are often referred to as  \"single\" or \"local\" methods. However, when dealing with a large amount of time series for some applications, it is beneficial to train a \"global\" model on all available time series, which enables the model to learn latent representations from many different sources.Document 3:::\n### Decomposition Layer\nDecomposition has long been a popular method in time series analysis, but it had not been extensively incorporated into deep learning models until the introduction of the Autoformer paper.

In contrast, deep learning methods for time series forecasting, such as those based on Transformers, can learn representations from multiple related time series and model the uncertainty of the data by outputting a probabilistic distribution instead of a single value. Additionally, deep learning methods can be trained globally on all available time series, allowing them to learn latent representations from many different sources, whereas classical methods are typically fitted on each time series individually.", "retrieved_docs": ["## Introduction\n\nTime series forecasting is an essential scientific and business problem and as such has also seen a lot of innovation recently with the use of [deep learning based](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3533382) models in addition to the [classical methods](https://otexts.com/fpp3/). An important difference between classical methods like ARIMA and novel deep learning methods is the following.\n\n##  Probabilistic Forecasting", "Some classical methods are point-valued (meaning, they just output a single value per time step) and models are trained by minimizing an L2 or L1 type of loss with respect to the ground truth data. However, since forecasts are often used in some real-world decision making pipeline, even with humans in the loop, it is much more beneficial to provide the uncertainties of predictions. This is also called \"probabilistic forecasting\", as opposed to \"point forecasting\". This entails modeling a probabilistic distribution, from which one can sample.\n\nSo in short, rather than training local point forecasting models, we hope to train **global probabilistic** models. Deep learning is a great fit for this, as neural networks can learn representations from several related time series as well as model the uncertainty of the data.", "##  Probabilistic Forecasting\n\nTypically, classical methods are fitted on each time series in a dataset individually. These are often referred to as  \"single\" or \"local\" methods. However, when dealing with a large amount of time series for some applications, it is beneficial to train a \"global\" model on all available time series, which enables the model to learn latent representations from many different sources.", "### Decomposition Layer\nDecomposition has long been a popular method in time series analysis, but it had not been extensively incorporated into deep learning models until the introduction of the Autoformer paper.

Ensure that your Gradio app has a `ChatInterface`.\n2. Run the command `gradio deploy --title echo-chatbot --app-file app.py` to deploy your app to Hugging Face spaces.\n3. Note the URL of the space that was created.\n4. To create a Discord bot, run the command `gradio deploy-discord --src freddyaboulton/echo-chatbot` (or `--src <your-space-name>`). If you already have a Discord bot token, you can pass it to the command using `--discord-bot-token <token>`.\n5. Follow the instructions provided in the console to obtain a Discord bot token (if you didn't already have one).\n6. Run the command again with the token to deploy the bot: `gradio deploy-discord --src freddyaboulton/echo-chatbot --discord-bot-token <token>`.\n7. Add the bot to your Discord server using the instructions provided in the console.\n\nAlternatively, you can deploy a pre-trained LLM as a Discord bot using the `gradio_client` library. For example, to deploy Meta's Llama 2 LLM with 70 billion parameters, go to this space and follow the instructions, or run the command `import gradio_client as grc; grc.Client(\"ysharma/Explore_llamav2_with_TGI\").deploy_discord(to_id=\"llama2-70b-discord-bot\")`.\n\nAdditional LLMs and deployment options are available in the template spaces provided by the `gradio-discord-bots` organization on Hugging Face.", "retrieved_docs": ["### Step 2: Deploying our App\n\nIn order to create a discord bot for our app, it must be accessible over the internet. In this guide, we will use the `gradio deploy` command to deploy our chatbot to Hugging Face spaces from the command line. Run the following command.\n\n```bash\ngradio deploy --title echo-chatbot --app-file app.py\n```\n\nThis command will ask you some questions, e.g. requested hardware, requirements, but the default values will suffice for this guide.\nNote the URL of the space that was created.

Import the necessary client libraries for SageMaker and Hugging Face Transformers.\n\n2. Retrieve the endpoint name, model name, and deployed model ID using the `list_endpoints()` method of the `SageMakerClient` class.\n\n3. Call the `cleanup()` function defined in Document 1 to delete the endpoint, model, and undeploy the model from the endpoint.\n\n4. Alternatively, you can also delete the endpoint directly using the `delete_endpoint()` method of the `HuggingFaceModel` class, as shown in Documents 2 and 5.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\nfrom sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel\nfrom sagemaker.predictor import Predictor\nfrom sagemaker.session import Session\n\nsession = Session()\nsagemaker_client = boto3.client('sagemaker', region_name='us-west-2')\n\n# Retrieve endpoint details\nresponse = sagemaker_client.list_endpoints()\nendpoints = response['Endpoints']\nfor endpoint in endpoints:\n    if 'my-endpoint-name' in endpoint['EndpointName']:\n        endpoint_name = endpoint['EndpointName']\n        model_name = endpoint['ModelName']\n        deployed_model_id = endpoint['DeployedModelId']\n\n# Cleanup resources\ndef cleanup(endpoint, model_name, deployed_model_id):\n    response = sagemaker_client.undeploy_model(\n        endpoint=endpoint, deployed_model_id=deployed_model_id\n    )\n    print(\"Running undeploy_model operation:\", response.operation.name)\n    print(response.result())\n\n    response = sagemaker_client.delete_endpoint(name=endpoint)\n    print(\"Running delete_endpoint operation:\", response.operation.name)\n    print(response.result())\n\n    response = sagemaker_client.delete_model(name=model_name)\n    print(\"Running delete_model operation:\", response.operation", "retrieved_docs": ["predictor.predict({\n\t'inputs': prompt,\n  \"parameters\" : {\n    \"max_length\": int(len(prompt) + max_generated_token_length),\n    \"temperature\": float(temperature),\n    \"eos_token_id\": int(tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(end_sequence)),\n    \"return_full_text\":False\n  }\n})\n```\n\n---\n\nTo delete your endpoint you can run. \n\n```python\npredictor.delete_endpoint()\n```\n\n## Conclusion", "## Cleaning up of resources\n\n\n```python\ndef cleanup(endpoint, model_name, deployed_model_id):\n    response = endpoint_service_client.undeploy_model(\n        endpoint=endpoint, deployed_model_id=deployed_model_id\n    )\n    print(\"running undeploy_model operation:\", response.operation.name)\n    print(response.result())\n\n    response = endpoint_service_client.delete_endpoint(name=endpoint)\n    print(\"running delete_endpoint operation:\", response.operation.name)\n    print(response.result())\n\n    response = model_service_client.delete_model(name=model_name)\n    print(\"running delete_model operation:\", response.operation.name)\n    print(response.result())", "# example request: you always need to define \"inputs\"\ndata = {\n   \"inputs\": \"Camera - You are awarded a SiPix Digital Camera! call 09061221066 fromm landline.

We're going to start at 5 by 10^-5 5 e minus 5, which is 20 times lower than the default. And secondly, we don't just want a constant learning rate - we can get even better performance if we 'decay' the learning rate down to a tiny value, or even 0, over the course of training. That's what this PolynomialDecay schedule thing is doing. That name might be intimidating, especially if you only vaguely remember what a polynomial is from maths class. However, all we need to do is tell it how long training is going to be, so it decays at the right speed - that's what this code here is doingDocument 1:::\n. We're computing how many minibatches the model is going to see over its entire training run, which is the size of the training set, divided by the batch_size to get the number of batches per epoch, and then multiplied by the number of epochs to get the total number of batches across the whole training run. Once we know how many training steps we're taking, we just pass all that information to the scheduler and we're ready to go. What does the polynomial decay schedule look like? With default options, it's actually just a linear schedule, so it looks like this - it starts at 5e-5, which means 5 times ten to the minus 5, and then decays down at a constant rate until it hits zero right at the very end of trainingDocument 2:::\nIn addition to lowering the learning rate, we have a second trick up our sleeve: We can slowly reduce the learning rate\nover the course of training. In the literature, you will sometimes see this referred to as *decaying* or *annealing*\nthe learning rate. In Keras, the best way to do this is to use a *learning rate scheduler*. A good one to use is\n`PolynomialDecay` \u2014 despite the name, with default settings it simply linearly decays the learning rate from the initial\nvalue to the final value over the course of training, which is exactly what we want. In order to use a scheduler correctly,\nthough, we need to tell it how long training is going to be. We compute that as `num_train_steps` below.\n\n```py\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers.schedules import PolynomialDecayDocument 3:::\n. So why do they call it polynomial and not linear? Because if you tweak the options, you can get a higher-order decay schedule, but there's no need to do that right now. Now, how do we use our learning rate schedule? Easy, we just pass it to Adam! You'll notice the first time when we compiled the model, we just passed it the string \"adam\". Keras recognizes the names of common optimizers and loss functions if you pass them as strings, so it saves time to do that if you only want the default settings. But we're professional machine learners now, with our very own learning rate schedule, so we have to do things properlyDocument 4:::\nFinally, the learning rate scheduler used by default is just a linear decay from the maximum value (5e-5) to 0. To properly define it, we need to know the number of training steps we will take, which is the number of epochs we want to run multiplied by the number of training batches (which is the length of our training dataloader). The `Trainer` uses three epochs by default, so we will follow that:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import get_schedulerDocument 5:::\n.1, showing that the model is learning.

In Document 3, it is mentioned that with default settings, the `PolynomialDecay` scheduler linearly decays the learning rate from the initial value to the final value over the course of training, and in Document 4, it is explained that the learning rate scheduler used by default is a linear decay from the maximum value (5e-5) to 0. Therefore, the starting learning rate of the polynomial decay schedule is 5e-5.", "retrieved_docs": [". We're going to start at 5 by 10^-5 5 e minus 5, which is 20 times lower than the default. And secondly, we don't just want a constant learning rate - we can get even better performance if we 'decay' the learning rate down to a tiny value, or even 0, over the course of training. That's what this PolynomialDecay schedule thing is doing. That name might be intimidating, especially if you only vaguely remember what a polynomial is from maths class. However, all we need to do is tell it how long training is going to be, so it decays at the right speed - that's what this code here is doing", ". We're computing how many minibatches the model is going to see over its entire training run, which is the size of the training set, divided by the batch_size to get the number of batches per epoch, and then multiplied by the number of epochs to get the total number of batches across the whole training run. Once we know how many training steps we're taking, we just pass all that information to the scheduler and we're ready to go. What does the polynomial decay schedule look like? With default options, it's actually just a linear schedule, so it looks like this - it starts at 5e-5, which means 5 times ten to the minus 5, and then decays down at a constant rate until it hits zero right at the very end of training", "In addition to lowering the learning rate, we have a second trick up our sleeve: We can slowly reduce the learning rate\nover the course of training. In the literature, you will sometimes see this referred to as *decaying* or *annealing*\nthe learning rate. In Keras, the best way to do this is to use a *learning rate scheduler*. A good one to use is\n`PolynomialDecay` \u2014 despite the name, with default settings it simply linearly decays the learning rate from the initial\nvalue to the final value over the course of training, which is exactly what we want. In order to use a scheduler correctly,\nthough, we need to tell it how long training is going to be. We compute that as `num_train_steps` below.\n\n```py\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers.schedules import PolynomialDecay", ". So why do they call it polynomial and not linear? Because if you tweak the options, you can get a higher-order decay schedule, but there's no need to do that right now. Now, how do we use our learning rate schedule? Easy, we just pass it to Adam! You'll notice the first time when we compiled the model, we just passed it the string \"adam\".

First, you need to get the imagenet class mappings. This can be done by downloading the `imagenet_classes.txt` file from the URL provided in one of the extracts (Document 1, 2, or 3). You can then read the file and store the category names in a list.\n\n2. After getting the class mappings, you can use the model to make predictions on an input image. The `softmax` function can be used to convert the output probabilities into a probability distribution over classes.\n\n3. To get the top-5 predictions, you can use the `torch.topk` function to find the indices and values of the top-5 elements in the probability distribution.\n\n4. Finally, you can use the `id2label` mapping provided by the model to convert the predicted class indices into actual class names.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to get the top-5 predictions class names using the model:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport urllib.request\nimport os\n\n# Load the model and set it to evaluation mode\nmodel = ...\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Load the image and preprocess it\nimg = Image.open('image.jpg')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\nimg = img.convert('RGB')\nimg = img.resize((224, ", "retrieved_docs": ["To get the model predictions:\n\n```py\n>>> import torch\n>>> with torch.no_grad():\n...     out = model(tensor)\n>>> probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)\n>>> print(probabilities.shape)\n>>> # prints: torch.Size([1000])\n```\n\nTo get the top-5 predictions class names:", "To get the top-5 predictions class names:\n\n```py\n>>> # Get imagenet class mappings\n>>> url, filename = (\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt\", \"imagenet_classes.txt\")\n>>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)\n>>> with open(\"imagenet_classes.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n...     categories = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]", "To get the top-5 predictions class names:\n\n```py\n>>> # Get imagenet class mappings\n>>> url, filename = (\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt\", \"imagenet_classes.txt\")\n>>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename) \n>>> with open(\"imagenet_classes.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n...     categories = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]", "To get the top-5 predictions class names:\n```python\n# Get imagenet class mappings\nurl, filename = (\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt\", \"imagenet_classes.txt\")\nurllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename) \nwith open(\"imagenet_classes.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    categories = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]", "# print the top 5 class predictions and their probabilities\ntop_class_preds = torch.argsort(preds, descending=True)[0, :5]\n\nfor c in top_class_preds:\n    print(f\"{model.config.id2label[c.item()]} with probability {round(preds[0, c.item()].item(), 4)}\")\n```", "Now we'll find the top 5 predicted class indexes and values using `torch.topk`.\n\n```py\n>>> values, indices = torch.topk(probabilities, 5)\n>>> indices\ntensor([162, 166, 161, 164, 167])\n```\n\nIf we check the imagenet labels for the top index, we can see what the model predicted...", "Get the predicted label with the highest probability, and use the model's `id2label` mapping to convert it to a label:\n\n```py\n>>> predicted_class_id = int(tf.math.argmax(logits, axis=-1)[0])\n>>> model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]\n'beignets'\n```\n\n</tf>\n</frameworkcontent>"], "test_settings": "reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta_rerank:True_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_chunk:200", "eval_score_Claude-3-Sonnet": "5", "eval_feedback_Claude-3-Sonnet": "Feedback: The provided response accurately explains the steps to get the top-5 prediction class names using the model.

Red-teaming shares some similarities with adversarial attacks in ML, as both aim to \"attack\" or \"fool\" the model to generate undesirable outputs in a real-world use case. However, red-teaming prompts are designed to be intelligible to humans and can reveal actionable insights into model limitations, which can be used to add guardrails and document model limitations.
