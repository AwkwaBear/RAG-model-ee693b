This can impact the generations of models that use it for prompt encoding, for instance by interpreting unspecified or underspecified gender and identity groups to signify white and male.Document 1:::\n-->\n\n# CLIP\n\n## Overview\n\nThe CLIP model was proposed in [Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) by Alec Radford, Jong Wook Kim, Chris Hallacy, Aditya Ramesh, Gabriel Goh,\nSandhini Agarwal, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, Pamela Mishkin, Jack Clark, Gretchen Krueger, Ilya Sutskever.

Make sure you have 🤗 Accelerate installed if you don't already have it:\n\n> Note: As Accelerate is rapidly developing, the git version of accelerate must be installed to run the scripts\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate\n```Document 1:::\nInference pipelines with the ONNX Runtime accelerator\n\nThe [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function makes it simple to use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)\nfor accelerated inference on a variety of tasks such as text classification, question answering and image classification.\n\n<Tip>\n\nYou can also use the\n[pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) function from\nTransformers and provide your Optimum model class.\n\n</Tip>\n\nCurrently the supported tasks are:Document 2:::\nAt this time of writing, the models that support accelerate are: \n```python\n[\n    'bigbird_pegasus', 'blip_2', 'bloom', 'bridgetower', 'codegen', 'deit', 'esm', \n    'gpt2', 'gpt_bigcode', 'gpt_neo', 'gpt_neox', 'gpt_neox_japanese', 'gptj', 'gptsan_japanese', \n    'lilt', 'llama', 'longformer', 'longt5', 'luke', 'm2m_100', 'mbart', 'mega', 'mt5', 'nllb_moe',Document 3:::\nAccelerate handles big models for inference in the following way:\n1. Instantiate the model with empty weights.\n2. Analyze the size of each layer and the available space on each device (GPUs, CPU) to decide where each layer should go.\n3. Load the model checkpoint bit by bit and put each weight on its device\n\nIt then ensures the model runs properly with hooks that transfer the inputs and outputs on the right device and that the model weights offloaded on the CPU (or even the disk) are loaded on a GPU just before the forward pass, before being offloaded again once the forward pass is finished.Document 4:::\n<Tip>\n\nTo run the example above you need to have [`pytesseract`](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) installed in addition to 🤗 Transformers:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y tesseract-ocr\npip install pytesseract\n```\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Using `pipeline` on large models with 🤗 `accelerate`:\n\nYou can easily run `pipeline` on large models using 🤗 `accelerate`! First make sure you have installed `accelerate` with `pip install accelerate`. \n\nFirst load your model using `device_map=\"auto\"`! We will use `facebook/opt-1.3b` for our example.\n\n```py\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipelineDocument 5:::\n- [🤗 Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) speeds up model loading for inference and training.\n- [🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) is required to run the most popular diffusion models, such as [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/overview).\n\n## DiffusionPipelineDocument 6:::\nThen step 2 will load in memory a second copy of the model (so another 26.8GB in RAM in default precision). If you were trying to load the largest models, for example BLOOM or OPT-176B (which both have 176 billion parameters), like this, you would need 1.4 **terabytes** of CPU RAM. That is a bit excessive! And all of this to just move the model on one (or several) GPU(s) at step 4.\n\nClearly we need something smarter. In this blog post, we'll explain how Accelerate leverages PyTorch features to load and run inference with very large models, even if they don't fit in RAM or one GPU. In a nutshell, it changes the process above like this:\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: How can I run a pipeline on a large model using 🤗 `accelerate`?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nTo run a pipeline on a large model using 🤗 `accelerate`, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure you have installed `accelerate` with `pip install accelerate`.\n2. Load your large model using `device_map=\"auto\"`. For example, you can use `facebook/opt-1.3b` as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-1.3b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-1.3b\", device_map=\"auto\")\n```\n\n3. Use the `pipeline()` function from `transformers` to create a pipeline for your task. For example, for text classification:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\ntext_classification_pipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-classification\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n```\n\n4. Pass your input to the pipeline and run inference:\n\n```python\nresult = text_classification_pipeline(\"This is a sample text.\")\nprint(result[\"labels\"][0])\n```\n\nBy using `device_map=\"auto\"`, `accelerate` will automatically load the model in a distributed manner across multiple devices, such as GPUs or CPUs, to fit the model in memory. This allows you to run inference on large models without requiring excessive amounts of RAM or a single GPU with enough memory.",

            "## Run a script with 🤗 Accelerate\n\n🤗 [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate) is a PyTorch-only library that offers a unified method for training a model on several types of setups (CPU-only, multiple GPUs, TPUs) while maintaining complete visibility into the PyTorch training loop. Make sure you have 🤗 Accelerate installed if you don't already have it:\n\n> Note: As Accelerate is rapidly developing, the git version of accelerate must be installed to run the scripts\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate\n```",

            "At this time of writing, the models that support accelerate are: \n```python\n[\n    'bigbird_pegasus', 'blip_2', 'bloom', 'bridgetower', 'codegen', 'deit', 'esm', \n    'gpt2', 'gpt_bigcode', 'gpt_neo', 'gpt_neox', 'gpt_neox_japanese', 'gptj', 'gptsan_japanese', \n    'lilt', 'llama', 'longformer', 'longt5', 'luke', 'm2m_100', 'mbart', 'mega', 'mt5', 'nllb_moe',",
            "Accelerate handles big models for inference in the following way:\n1. Instantiate the model with empty weights.\n2. Analyze the size of each layer and the available space on each device (GPUs, CPU) to decide where each layer should go.\n3. Load the model checkpoint bit by bit and put each weight on its device\n\nIt then ensures the model runs properly with hooks that transfer the inputs and outputs on the right device and that the model weights offloaded on the CPU (or even the disk) are loaded on a GPU just before the forward pass, before being offloaded again once the forward pass is finished.",
            "<Tip>\n\nTo run the example above you need to have [`pytesseract`](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) installed in addition to 🤗 Transformers:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y tesseract-ocr\npip install pytesseract\n```\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Using `pipeline` on large models with 🤗 `accelerate`:\n\nYou can easily run `pipeline` on large models using 🤗 `accelerate`! First make sure you have installed `accelerate` with `pip install accelerate`. \n\nFirst load your model using `device_map=\"auto\"`! We will use `facebook/opt-1.3b` for our example.\n\n```py\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline",

            "Then step 2 will load in memory a second copy of the model (so another 26.8GB in RAM in default precision). If you were trying to load the largest models, for example BLOOM or OPT-176B (which both have 176 billion parameters), like this, you would need 1.4 **terabytes** of CPU RAM. That is a bit excessive! And all of this to just move the model on one (or several) GPU(s) at step 4.\n\nClearly we need something smarter.

Thanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)!\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: How do I scroll to the output in the Gradio demo?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nAnswer: In Gradio's demo, you can scroll to the output by using the auto scroll feature. This functionality was added in PR #5417 (commit d14d63e3) and is accessible through the `gr.Textbox()` function with the `autoscroll` parameter, which was introduced in PR #5488 (commit 8909e42a) and is thanks to contributor @dawoodkhan82. Additionally, PR #1077 (contributed by @pngwn) and PR #1085 (contributed by @freddyaboulton) also contributed to the scrolling functionality. To use auto scroll, simply create a `gr.Textbox()` object with the `autoscroll` parameter set to `True`. The output will automatically scroll to the bottom as it updates. If you want to pause the auto scrolling temporarily, you can scroll up in the textbox, and it will resume when you scroll all the way down again, as implemented in PR #5652 (commits 2e25d4305 and 2e25d43058) by contributor @abidlabs. However, in Document 4, it is mentioned that scrolling to output is already implemented by contributor @pngwn in PR #1077. So, it's possible that the auto scroll feature is already enabled by default in the demo, and you don't need to explicitly set the `autoscroll` parameter. I recommend checking the demo to confirm this.",

This format is commonly used for storing and processing large datasets in JSON format. To load a JSON Lines dataset in Hugging Face's Transformers library, you can use the `load_dataset()` function with the `\"json\"` format and pass the file or URL as the `data_files` argument. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoConfig, AutoTokenizer, Trainer\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Load the JSON Lines dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files=\"my_file.jsonl\")\n\n# Preprocess the data using a Hugging Face tokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n# Define the configuration and training arguments\nconfig = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\", config=config),\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    args=TrainingArguments(per_device_train_batch_size=32, num_train_epochs=3),\n)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\nIn this example, we first load the JSON Lines dataset using the `load_dataset()` function from Hugging Face's Datasets library. We then define the configuration and training arguments using the `AutoConfig` and `TrainingArguments` classes from the Transformers library. Finally, we create a `Trainer` object and call its `train()` method to start the training process. Note that the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class is used to create the model, which is pretrained on the BERT base uncased model.",

In simpler terms, an architecture is like a building plan, while a checkpoint is the actual construction or state of the building at a certain point in time.

            "The component exposes a prop named `root`. \nThis is passed down by the parent gradio app and it represents the base url that the files will be uploaded to and fetched from.\n\nFor WASM support, you should get the upload function from the `Context` and pass that as the third parameter of the `upload` function.\n\n```typescript\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n    import { getContext } from \"svelte\";\n    const upload_fn = getContext<typeof upload_files>(\"upload_files\");\n\n    async function handle_upload(file_data: FileData[]): Promise<void> {\n        await tick();\n        await upload(file_data, root, upload_fn);\n    }\n</script>\n```",
            "## Handling Files\n\nIf your component deals with files, these files **should** be uploaded to the backend server. \nThe `@gradio/client` npm package provides the `upload`, `prepare_files`, and `normalise_file` utility functions to help you do this.\n\nThe `prepare_files` function will convert the browser's `File` datatype to gradio's internal `FileData` type.\nYou should use the `FileData` data in your component to keep track of uploaded files.\n\nThe `upload` function will upload an array of `FileData` values to the server.\n\nThe `normalise_file` function will generate the correct URL for your component to fetch the file from and set it to the `data` property of the `FileData.`",

Therefore, the license for this model is not explicitly stated in the context provided. However, the context does mention that the licenses for the models in Documents 1 and 2 are either the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) license or the SEER license, which can be found in their respective project directories. The context also mentions that Gradio, a tool for sharing and testing machine learning models, is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, and that a custom license called \"coqui-public-model-license\" is used for some Coqui models, which can be found in their project metadata. Based on the provided context, it is unclear whether the license for the keyfan/vicuna-chinese-replication-beta model is one of these licenses or a different one.

This allows for more flexibility in defining inputs and outputs for your Gradio application. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ninput_textbox = gr.Textbox()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Examples([\"hello\", \"bonjour\", \"merhaba\"], input_textbox)\n\ninput_textbox.render(location=\"my_app.html\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we create the Textbox object `input_textbox` outside of the `gr.Blocks()` scope. We then use it inside the `gr.Blocks()` scope to define our application. After defining the application, we render the Textbox object using its `.render()` method, specifying the location where it should be rendered (in this case, `\"my_app.html\"`). This allows us to use the Textbox object in multiple places within our Gradio application, without having to define it multiple times.",

The JIT compiler traces code during the first run and generates highly optimized TPU binaries that are re-used in subsequent calls.\nThe catch of this process is that it requires all input, intermediate, and output shapes to be **static**, meaning that they must be known in advance. Every time we change the shapes\na new and costly compilation process will be triggered again. JIT compilation is ideal for services that can be designed around static shapes: compilation runs once, and then we take advantage of super-fast inference times.Document 1:::\n- **Compilation**. JAX uses just-in-time (jit) compilation of JAX Python functions so it can be executed efficiently in XLA. In order to get the best performance, we must use static shapes for jitted functions, this is because JAX transforms work by tracing a function and to determine its effect on inputs of a specific shape and type. When a new shape is introduced to an already compiled function, it retriggers compilation on the new shape, which can greatly reduce performance. **Note**: JIT compilation is particularly well-suited for text-to-image generation because all inputs and outputs (image input / output sizes) are static.Document 2:::\nTo take advantage of JAX's optimized speed on a TPU, pass `jit=True` to the pipeline to compile the JAX code into an efficient representation and to ensure the model runs in parallel across the 8 devices.\n\n<Tip warning={true}>\n\nYou need to ensure all your inputs have the same shape in subsequent calls, otherwise JAX will need to recompile the code which is slower.\n\n</Tip>\n\nThe first inference run takes more time because it needs to compile the code, but subsequent calls (even with different inputs) are much faster. For example, it took more than a minute to compile on a TPU v2-8, but then it takes about **7s** on a future inference run!Document 3:::\n## Why JAX + TPU v5e for SDXL?\n\nServing SDXL with JAX on Cloud TPU v5e with high performance and cost-efficiency is possible thanks to the combination of purpose-built TPU hardware and a software stack optimized for performance. Below we highlight two key factors: JAX just-in-time (jit) compilation and XLA compiler-driven parallelism with JAX pmap.\n\n#### JIT compilationDocument 4:::\nImage generation is well-suited for JIT compilation. If we always generate the same number of images and they have the same size, then the output shapes are constant and known in advance. The text inputs are also constant: by design, Stable Diffusion and SDXL use fixed-shape embedding vectors (with padding) to represent the prompts typed by the user. Therefore, we can write JAX code that relies on fixed shapes, and that can be greatly optimized!\n\n#### High-performance throughput for high batch sizesDocument 5:::\n`jax.pmap` does two things:\n\n1. Compiles (or \"`jit`s\") the code which is similar to `jax.jit()`. This does not happen when you call `pmap`, and only the first time the `pmap`ped function is called.\n2. Ensures the compiled code runs in parallel on all available devices.\n\nTo demonstrate, call `pmap` on the pipeline's `_generate` method (this is a private method that generates images and may be renamed or removed in future releases of 🤗 Diffusers):\n\n```python\np_generate = pmap(pipeline._generate)\n```\n\nAfter calling `pmap`, the prepared function `p_generate` will:Document 6:::\noutputs = run_model(**inputs)\n```\n\nWe use `jax.jit` to compile the function to get maximum performance. Note that in the above example, we set `padding=max_length` to pad all examples to the same length. We do this because JAX's compiler has to recompile a function everytime its input shape changes - in a sense a compiled function is not only defined by its code but also by its input and output shape. It is usually much more effective to pad the input to be of a fixed static shape than having to recompile every the function multiple times.\n\n\n#### **How to write a training loop**\n\nNow let's see how we can write a simple training loop to train Flax models, we will use `FlaxGPT2ForCausalLM` as an example.\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is JIT compilation in JAX?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nJIT compilation in JAX refers to the process of tracing and compiling Python functions during runtime to generate highly optimized TPU binaries that can be executed efficiently.

This pre-processing lets you ensure that the underlying\n`Model` does not build tokens across multiple \"splits\". For example if\nyou don't want to have whitespaces inside a token, then you can have a\n`PreTokenizer` that splits on these whitespaces.\n\nYou can easily combine multiple `PreTokenizer` together using a\n`Sequence` (see below). The `PreTokenizer` is also allowed to modify the\nstring, just like a `Normalizer` does. This is necessary to allow some\ncomplicated algorithms that require to split before normalizing (e.g.\nthe ByteLevel)\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the pre-tokenizer that splits text by whitespace?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nThe name of the pre-tokenizer that splits text by whitespace is \"Whitespace\" (Document 6:::).

This can result in more random and unpredictable output compared to lower temperatures, which prioritize sampling tokens with higher likelihoods. However, very high temperatures can also lead to less coherent and less meaningful output, as the model may struggle to generate sequences that make sense in context. It's generally recommended to use lower temperatures for tasks that require more structure and predictability, such as code-related tasks, and higher temperatures for more open-ended and exploratory tasks, such as text generation.",

For example:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest\n```\n\nwill run all the tests inside that class.\n\nAs mentioned earlier you can see what tests are contained inside the `OptimizationTest` class by running:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest --collect-only -q\n```\n\nYou can run tests by keyword expressions.Document 1:::\nThis would lead to only looking for file changes in the respective directories, specified relatively to the ini-file’s\ndirectory.\n\n[pytest-watch](https://github.com/joeyespo/pytest-watch) is an alternative implementation of this functionality.\n\n\n### Skip a test module\n\nIf you want to run all test modules, except a few you can exclude them by giving an explicit list of tests to run. For\nexample, to run all except `test_modeling_*.py` tests:\n\n```bash\npytest *ls -1 tests/*py | grep -v test_modeling*\n```\n\n### Clearing state\n\nCI builds and when isolation is important (against speed), cache should be cleared:Document 2:::\nAll tests of a given test file:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/test_optimization.py --collect-only -q\n```\n\n### Run a specific test module\n\nTo run an individual test module:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/utils/test_logging.py\n```\n\n### Run specific tests\n\nSince unittest is used inside most of the tests, to run specific subtests you need to know the name of the unittest\nclass containing those tests. For example, it could be:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest::test_adam_w\n```\n\nHere:Document 3:::\n```\n\nJust run the following line to automatically test every docstring example in the desired file: \n```bash \npytest --doctest-modules <path_to_file_or_dir>\n```\nIf the file has a markdown extention, you should add the `--doctest-glob=\"*.md\"` argument.\n\n### Run only modified tests\n\nYou can run the tests related to the unstaged files or the current branch (according to Git) by using [pytest-picked](https://github.com/anapaulagomes/pytest-picked).

Here's how:\n\n1. Install pytest-picked:\n\n```bash\npip install pytest-picked\n```\n\n2. Add the following line to your `pytest.ini` file:\n\n```ini\n[pytest]\naddopts = -r picked\n```\n\n3. Run pytest with the `-p` flag to enable the plugin:\n\n```bash\npytest -p picked tests/your_file.py\n```\n\nThis will run only the tests that have been modified since the last commit or since the last time the file was staged. If you want to run tests for a specific branch, you can use the `--branch` option instead of `--staged`.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `--pick` option to select specific tests based on their names or patterns. For example:\n\n```bash\npytest -p picked --pick='test_my_function' tests/your_file.py\n```\n\nThis will run only the `test_my_function` test in the specified file.\n\nNote that pytest-picked requires Git to be installed and configured, as it uses Git's API to determine which tests have been modified. If you're not using Git, you can still use pytest's built-in `--doctest-modules` or `--collect-only` options to run specific tests or test modules.",

For example:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest\n```\n\nwill run all the tests inside that class.\n\nAs mentioned earlier you can see what tests are contained inside the `OptimizationTest` class by running:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/test_optimization.py::OptimizationTest --collect-only -q\n```\n\nYou can run tests by keyword expressions.",

This will calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient between predicted and reference scores, and consider predictions as correct if their Spearman correlation coefficient is greater than or equal to the defined threshold.

Load the base model using `AutoModelForCausalLM` or the base model class like `OPTForCausalLM` or `LlamaForCausalLM`.\n\n2. Create a `PeftMixedModel` object by passing the base model and the path to the first adapter.\n\n3. Load the second adapter using the `load_adapter` method of the `PeftMixedModel` object, passing the path to the adapter and a name for the adapter (e.g., \"other\").\n\n4.

If you want to compare or use more than one adapter, you can also call the `add_adapter` method to add the adapter configuration to the base model.\n\nTo save your trained adapter and load it back, you can use the `save_pretrained` and `from_pretrained` methods of the `AutoModelForCausalLM` class.\n\nAlso, you can load a PEFT adapter using the `load_adapter` method, which allows you to load the adapter using either an `AutoModelFor` class or the base model class like `OPTForCausalLM` or `LlamaForCausalLM`.\n\nFinally, you can load a specific model using the `from_pretrained` method of the model class.

Remember that because different models have different padding tokens, DataCollatorWithPadding will need your model's Tokenizer so it knows how to pad sequences properly!

For PyTorch users, you usually pass the DataCollator to your Trainer object. In TensorFlow, the easiest way to use a DataCollator is to pass it to the to_tf_dataset method of your dataset. You'll see these approaches used in the examples and notebooks throughout this course. In both cases, you end up with an iterable that's going to output collated batches, ready for training",
            ". The main thing to know here is that it can be a real pain to implement yourself, but DataCollatorForLanguageModeling will do it for you. And that's it! That covers the most commonly used data collators and the tasks they're used for.",
            ". These are DefaultDataCollator and DataCollatorWithPadding. These are the ones you should use if your labels are straightforward and your data doesn't need any special processing before being ready for training. Most sequence classification tasks, for example, would use one of these data collators. Remember that because different models have different padding tokens, DataCollatorWithPadding will need your model's Tokenizer so it knows how to pad sequences properly! So how do you choose one of these? Simple: As you can see here, if you have variable sequence lengths then you should use DataCollatorWithPadding, which will pad all your sequences to the same length",

The paper \"Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot\" also mentions that Blenderbot is trained on a large corpus of text and can handle a wide range of topics and styles, which further contributes to its ability to generate more varied responses. However, the specific level of variability and quality of responses may depend on the input prompts and the training data used for the model.",

The benchmark consists of 192 experiments with these configurations. The context in Document 2 provides some initial results for specific tasks and model sizes, but the exact nature of the benchmark and its tasks are not explicitly stated. However, based on the context in Document 5, it can be inferred that the benchmark is related to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as the `SFTTrainer` from TRL library is mentioned and the Guananco model cited in the paper is available for testing on the Hugging Face playground. Therefore, it can be assumed that the benchmark involves NLP tasks such as question answering (QA) and table question answering (TQA). However, without further information, the exact nature of the benchmark and its tasks remain unclear.",

Say we would like to get the feature map of the stem.\n```python\n>>> list(feature_maps[0].shape)\n[1, 96, 56, 56]\n```\n\nWe can get the feature maps of first and second stages like below.\n```python\n>>> list(feature_maps[1].shape)\n[1, 96, 56, 56]\n>>> list(feature_maps[2].shape)\n[1, 192, 28, 28]\n```\n\n## Initializing Backbone ConfigurationDocument 3:::\nYou can use `AutoBackbone` class to initialize a model as a backbone and get the feature maps for any stage. You can define `out_indices` to indicate the index of the layers which you would like to get the feature maps from. You can also use `out_features` if you know the name of the layers. You can use them interchangeably. If you are using both `out_indices` and `out_features`, ensure they are consistent. Not passing any of the feature map arguments will make the backbone yield the feature maps of the last layer.\nTo visualize how stages look like, let's take the Swin model. Each stage is responsible from feature extraction, outputting feature maps.\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">Document 4:::\n### Query the feature information\n\nAfter a feature backbone has been created, it can be queried to provide channel or resolution reduction information to the downstream heads without requiring static config or hardcoded constants.

Import the required modules:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   import timm\n   ```\n\n2. Create the model with the `features_only` argument set to `True`:\n\n   ```python\n   model = timm.create_model('resnet18', features_only=True, pretrained=True)\n   ```\n\n   Here, replace 'resnet18' with the name of the desired backbone.\n\n3. Call the `create_model` function with the `features_only` argument set to `True` to create the feature backbone. This will return a model that outputs feature maps instead of the final predictions.\n\n4. To get feature maps from specific stages, you can access them from the `feature_maps` dictionary returned by the model's forward pass. For example, to get the feature map of the stem, you can access the first element of the `feature_maps` dictionary:\n\n   ```python\n   inputs = processor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n   outputs = model(**inputs)\n   feature_maps = outputs.feature_maps\n   stem_map = feature_maps[0]\n   ```\n\n   Here, `processor` is a function provided by timm to preprocess the input image.\n\n5.

This allows you to specify which stages you want to extract feature maps from using the `out_indices` or `out_features` arguments.

Well, the “sum” in ROUGE-LSUM refers to the fact that this metric is computed over a whole summary, while ROUGE-L is computed as the average over individual sentences"

By turning your Gradio app into a Discord bot, you can bring cutting edge AI to your discord server and give your community a whole new way to interact.\n\n## 💻 How does it work? 💻\n\nWith `gradio_client` version `0.3.0`, any gradio `ChatInterface` app on the internet can automatically be deployed as a discord bot via the `deploy_discord` method of the `Client` class.Document 1:::\nYou can also create a discord bot from a deployed gradio app with python.\n\n```python\nimport gradio_client as grc\ngrc.Client(\"freddyaboulton/echo-chatbot\").deploy_discord()\n```\n\n## 🦾 Using State of The Art LLMs 🦾\n\nWe have created an organization on Hugging Face called [gradio-discord-bots](https://huggingface.co/gradio-discord-bots) containing several template spaces that explain how to deploy state of the art LLMs powered by gradio as discord bots.Document 2:::\nTo deploy any of these models to discord, simply follow the instructions in the linked space for that model.\n\n## Deploying non-chat gradio apps to discord\n\nAs mentioned above, you don't need a `gr.ChatInterface` if you want to deploy your gradio app to discord. All that's needed is an api route that takes in a single string and outputs a single string.\n\nThe following code will deploy a space that translates english to german as a discord bot.\n\n```python\nimport gradio_client as grc\nclient = grc.Client(\"freddyaboulton/english-to-german\")\nclient.deploy_discord(api_names=['german'])\n```\n\n## ConclusionDocument 3:::\n- [#5076](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5076) [`2745075a`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/2745075a26f80e0e16863d483401ff1b6c5ada7a) - Add deploy_discord to docs.

Mine is https://huggingface.co/spaces/freddyaboulton/echo-chatbot\n\n### Step 3: Creating a Discord Bot\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: How to deploy a gradio app as a discord bot?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nTo deploy a Gradio app as a Discord bot, follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that your Gradio app has a `gr.ChatInterface` component.\n2. Install the `gradio_client` package by running `pip install gradio_client`.\n3. Connect to your Gradio app using the `Client` class from `gradio_client`. For example, `client = grc.Client(\"your-app-name\")`.\n4. Deploy the app as a Discord bot by calling the `deploy_discord` method of the `Client` object. For example, `client.deploy_discord()`.\n\nAlternatively, you can also create a Discord bot from a deployed Gradio app using Python. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio_client as grc\n\n# Replace \"your-app-name\" with the name of your deployed Gradio app\nclient = grc.Client(\"your-app-name\")\nclient.deploy_discord()\n```\n\nNote that you don't necessarily need a `gr.ChatInterface` component to deploy a Gradio app as a Discord bot. As long as your app has an API route that takes a single string as input and returns a single string as output, you can still deploy it as a Discord bot using the `deploy_discord` method.\n\nFor more information on deploying Gradio apps as Discord bots, including examples of deploying state-of-the-art LLMs, refer to the documentation provided in the context. Specifically, see Document 3 for the release notes for version 3.39.0, which introduced the ability to create Discord bots from Gradio apps, and Document 5 for the release notes for version 0.3.0, which also introduced this feature. Additionally, Document 1 provides a simple Python example of creating a Discord bot from a deployed Gradio app, and Document 2 contains links to templates for deploying state-of-the-art LLMs as Discord bots.",

            "🚀 Creating Discord Bots from Gradio Apps 🚀\n\nTags: NLP, TEXT, CHAT\n\nWe're excited to announce that Gradio can now automatically create a discord bot from a deployed app! 🤖\n\nDiscord is a popular communication platform that allows users to chat and interact with each other in real-time. By turning your Gradio app into a Discord bot, you can bring cutting edge AI to your discord server and give your community a whole new way to interact.\n\n## 💻 How does it work? 💻\n\nWith `gradio_client` version `0.3.0`, any gradio `ChatInterface` app on the internet can automatically be deployed as a discord bot via the `deploy_discord` method of the `Client` class.",
            "You can also create a discord bot from a deployed gradio app with python.\n\n```python\nimport gradio_client as grc\ngrc.Client(\"freddyaboulton/echo-chatbot\").deploy_discord()\n```\n\n## 🦾 Using State of The Art LLMs 🦾\n\nWe have created an organization on Hugging Face called [gradio-discord-bots](https://huggingface.co/gradio-discord-bots) containing several template spaces that explain how to deploy state of the art LLMs powered by gradio as discord bots.",
            "To deploy any of these models to discord, simply follow the instructions in the linked space for that model.\n\n## Deploying non-chat gradio apps to discord\n\nAs mentioned above, you don't need a `gr.ChatInterface` if you want to deploy your gradio app to discord. All that's needed is an api route that takes in a single string and outputs a single string.\n\nThe following code will deploy a space that translates english to german as a discord bot.\n\n```python\nimport gradio_client as grc\nclient = grc.Client(\"freddyaboulton/english-to-german\")\nclient.deploy_discord(api_names=['german'])\n```\n\n## Conclusion",

            "</Tip>\n\nCurrently the supported tasks are:\n\n* `feature-extraction`\n* `text-classification`\n* `token-classification`\n* `question-answering`\n* `zero-shot-classification`\n* `text-generation`\n* `text2text-generation`\n* `summarization`\n* `translation`\n* `image-classification`\n* `automatic-speech-recognition`\n* `image-to-text`\n\n## Optimum pipeline usage\n\nWhile each task has an associated pipeline class, it is simpler to use the general [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function which wraps all the task-specific pipelines in one object.\nThe [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function automatically loads a default model and tokenizer/feature-extractor capable of performing inference for your task.",
            "### Automatic speech recognition\n\nAutomatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes speech into text. It is one of the most common audio tasks due partly to speech being such a natural form of human communication. Today, ASR systems are embedded in \"smart\" technology products like speakers, phones, and cars. We can ask our virtual assistants to play music, set reminders, and tell us the weather. \n\nBut one of the key challenges Transformer architectures have helped with is in low-resource languages. By pretraining on large amounts of speech data, finetuning the model on only one hour of labeled speech data in a low-resource language can still produce high-quality results compared to previous ASR systems trained on 100x more labeled data.\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import pipeline"

If you haven’t come across them before, logits are the outputs of the last layer of the network, before a softmax has been applied. So if you want to turn the logits into the model’s probability outputs, you just apply a softmax, like so. What if we want to turn those probabilities into class predictions? Simple, we just pick the biggest probability for each output! The easiest way to do that is with the argmax function. Argmax will return the index of the largest probability in each row, which means in this case that we’ll get a vector of 0 and 1 values. Those are our class predictions!

This can be done using the `argmax` function in Python. Alternatively, if the model outputs probabilities instead of logits, a softmax function can be applied to convert the probabilities into a probability distribution over classes, and then the `argmax` function can be used to find the predicted class based on the highest probability.

Load the configuration file of the pretrained model using the `from_pretrained` method of the corresponding configuration class. For example, to load the configuration of a BART model, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   from transformers import BartConfig\n   config = BartConfig.from_pretrained(\"./norwegian-bart-base\")\n   ```\n\n2. Save the configuration file to the local folder where the pretrained model weights are located.\n\n3. Instantiate the pretrained model using the `from_pretrained` method of the corresponding model class, passing the path to the local folder as an argument. For example, to instantiate a BART model from the local folder, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   from transformers import BartForSequenceClassification\n   model = BartForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"./norwegian-bart-base\")\n   ```\n\nAlternatively, you can also load the configuration and weights files separately using the `from_dict` and `from_state_dict` methods, respectively. However, using the `from_pretrained` method is more convenient and ensures that the correct configuration and weights files are loaded.\n\nNote that this approach is useful when you want to work with pretrained models that are not available on the Hugging Face Hub or when you want to avoid downloading them from the internet.",

For example, SentenceBert model ([Reimers and Gurevych, 2019](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1410.pdf)) uses Transformer, the cornerstone of many NLP applications, followed by a pooling operation over the contextualized word vectors. (c.f. Figure below.)\n\n![snippet](assets/32_1b_sentence_embeddings/model.png)\n\n### Multiple Negative Ranking Loss",
            "Now it's easy to compute the loss of the model on the corpus!\n\n```python\ndef compute_loss(model):\n    loss = 0\n    for word, freq in word_freqs.items():\n        _, word_loss = encode_word(word, model)\n        loss += freq * word_loss\n    return loss\n```\n\nWe can check it works on the model we have:\n\n```python\ncompute_loss(model)\n```\n\n```python out\n413.10377642940875\n```\n\nComputing the scores for each token is not very hard either; we just have to compute the loss for the models obtained by deleting each token:\n\n```python\nimport copy",
            "Those probabilities are defined by the loss the tokenizer is trained on. Assuming that the training data consists of\nthe words \\\\(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{N}\\\\) and that the set of all possible tokenizations for a word \\\\(x_{i}\\\\) is\ndefined as \\\\(S(x_{i})\\\\), then the overall loss is defined as\n\n$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log \\left ( \\sum_{x \\in S(x_{i})} p(x) \\right )$$\n\n<a id='sentencepiece'></a>\n\n### SentencePiece"

First, you need to download the imagenet class mappings from the URL provided in the code snippets (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt). You can do this using the `urllib.request.urlretrieve()` function in Python.\n\n2. After downloading the class mappings, you can read them into a list called `categories` using a list comprehension and the `readlines()` method of the file object.\n\n3. Now, you can pass the input image through the model and get the logits (unscaled scores) using the `forward()` method of the model.\n\n4. To get the top-5 predictions, you can use the `torch.argsort()` function to sort the logits in descending order and select the top-5 indices using the `slice()` function.\n\n5. Finally, you can use the `item()` method of the tensor to get the actual class indices and then look up the corresponding class names from the `categories` list.\n\nHere's the code snippet to get the top-5 predictions class names:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom torchvision import models, transforms\n\n# Load the pre-trained ResNet-18 model\nmodel = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Define the transformations to preprocess the input image\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize((224, 224)), transforms.ToTensor()])\n\n# Load the input image and preprocess it\nimage = Image.open('input.jpg')\nimage = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)\n\n# Pass the input image through the model and get the logits\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    logits = model(image)\n\n# Sort the logits in descending order and select the top-5 indices\ntop_indices = logits.argsort(-1)[0, :5]\n\n# Look up the corresponding class names from the categories list\ncategories = [s.strip() for s in open('imagenet_classes",

A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. So in this example, \"I loved reading the Hunger Games\" is the longest common subsequence.

It compares an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation, and assigns a single numerical score to the summary to measure its quality. ROUGE is case insensitive and is used to evaluate the quality of summaries generated by models like T5. There are several variants of ROUGE, including ROUGE-1 (unigram), ROUGE-2 (bigram), and ROUGE-L (Longest common subsequence). The use of ROUGE-LSum, which splits text using newlines, is also discussed in some sources. The use of ROUGE for evaluation is particularly important for tasks where traditional metrics like accuracy or F1 score are not applicable.",

            ". The last ROUGE variant we'll discuss is ROUGE-L. ROUGE-L doesn't compare n-grams, but instead treats each summary as a sequence of words and then looks for the longest common subsequence or LCS. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. So in this example, \"I loved reading the Hunger Games\" is the longest common subsequence. The main advantage of ROUGE-L over ROUGE-1 or ROUGE-2 is that is doesn't depend on consecutive n-gram matches, so it tends to capture sentence structure more accurately",

Using the \nlarge AudioLDM 2 checkpoint will result in higher overall memory usage than the base checkpoint, since the UNet is over \ntwice the size (750M parameters compared to 350M), so this memory saving trick is particularly beneficial here.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we showcased four optimisation methods that are available out of the box with 🧨 Diffusers, taking \nthe generation time of AudioLDM 2 from 14 seconds down to less than 1 second. We also highlighted how to employ memory \nsaving tricks, such as half-precision and CPU offload, to reduce peak memory usage for long audio samples or large \ncheckpoint sizes.Document 3:::\n# AudioLDM 2\n\nAudioLDM 2 was proposed in [AudioLDM 2: Learning Holistic Audio Generation with Self-supervised Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05734) by Haohe Liu et al.

Trained on AudioCaps with a single GPU, AudioLDM achieves state-of-the-art TTA performance measured by both objective and subjective metrics (e.g., frechet distance).

            "And with that, we can generate four samples, each of 150 seconds in duration, all in one call to the pipeline! Using the \nlarge AudioLDM 2 checkpoint will result in higher overall memory usage than the base checkpoint, since the UNet is over \ntwice the size (750M parameters compared to 350M), so this memory saving trick is particularly beneficial here.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we showcased four optimisation methods that are available out of the box with 🧨 Diffusers, taking \nthe generation time of AudioLDM 2 from 14 seconds down to less than 1 second. We also highlighted how to employ memory \nsaving tricks, such as half-precision and CPU offload, to reduce peak memory usage for long audio samples or large \ncheckpoint sizes.",

AudioLDM 2 takes a text prompt as input and predicts the corresponding audio. It can generate text-conditional sound effects, human speech and music.",
            ". Trained on AudioCaps with a single GPU, AudioLDM achieves state-of-the-art TTA performance measured by both objective and subjective metrics (e.g., frechet distance). Moreover, AudioLDM is the first TTA system that enables various text-guided audio manipulations (e.g., style transfer) in a zero-shot fashion.

It focuses specifically on the quality of these models, as opposed to other leaderboards that focus on factors like latency, throughput, and memory utilization. The leaderboard includes benchmarks such as Winogrande, GSM8k, and DROP, which are evaluated using the EleutherAI Harness, a community-maintained evaluation library. The leaderboard has recently gained attention due to the addition of Falcon, a new large language model, and the discovery of unexpected trends in the DROP scores of pretrained models.

[Open LLM-Perf Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/optimum/llm-perf-leaderboard), which focuses on LLM throughput.\n\n### Latency, throughput and memory utilization\n\n1. [Guide](llm_tutorial_optimization) on how to optimize LLMs for speed and memory;\n2. [Guide](main_classes/quantization) on quantization such as bitsandbytes and autogptq, which shows you how to drastically reduce your memory requirements.",
            "We added it to the Open LLM Leaderboard three weeks ago, and observed that the f1-scores of pretrained models followed an unexpected trend: when we plotted DROP scores against the leaderboard original average (of ARC, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA and MMLU), which is a reasonable proxy for overall model performance, we expected DROP scores to be correlated with it (with better models having better performance). However, this was only the case for a small number of models, and all the others had a very low DROP f1-score, below 10.",
            "In our quest, we discussed with both the great [@javier-m](https://huggingface.co/javier-m) who collaborated on the evaluations of LLaMA and the amazing [@slippylolo](https://huggingface.co/slippylolo) from the Falcon team. This being said, all the errors in the below should be attributed to us rather than them of course!\n\nAlong this journey with us you’ll learn a lot about the ways you can evaluate a model on a single evaluation and whether or not to believe the numbers you see online and in papers.\n\nReady?

This method is backed by the `huggingface_hub` Python package, which offers a direct API to the Hugging Face Hub. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Make sure you're logged in to your Hugging Face account. You can do this by running `huggingface-cli login` in your terminal.\n\n2. Import the `push_to_hub()` method from the `transformers` library:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import PreTrainedModel\n```\n\n3. Call the `push_to_hub()` method on your trained model, passing the name of the repository where you want to save the model:\n\n```python\nmodel.push_to_hub(\"your-name/bigscience/mt0-large-lora\")\n```\n\nThis will automatically create a new repository on the Hugging Face Hub with the given name and save your model there. The repository will also include an initial model card with an overview of the topics created by the model, if applicable.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `huggingface_hub` Python package directly to push your model to the Hub. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom huggingface_hub import Repository, login_user_from_token\n\nlogin_user_from_token(\"YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN\")\nrepo = Repository.push_or_create(\"your-name/bigscience/mt0-large-lora\", commit_message=\"Pushing model to Hugging Face Hub\")\nrepo.push(commit_message=\"Adding model file\")\n```\n\nIn this example, you first log in to your Hugging Face account using your token. Then, you create a new repository or push an existing one to the Hub, passing the name of the repository and a commit message. Finally, you push the model file to the repository using the `push()` method.\n\nNote that you'll need to have Git LFS installed to push large files like model weights to the Hub.",
