Instead of creating the full model, then loading the pretrained weights inside it (which takes twice the size of the model in RAM, one for the randomly initialized model, one for the weights), there is an option to create the model as an empty shell, then only materialize its parameters when the pretrained weights are loaded.Document 5:::\nOn top of `Pipelines` and depending on the model type, there are several production optimizations like:\n- compiling models to optimized intermediary representations (e.g. [ONNX](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/accelerate-your-nlp-pipelines-using-hugging-face-transformers-and-onnx-runtime-2443578f4333)),\n- maintaining a Least Recently Used cache, ensuring that the most popular models are always loaded,\n- scaling the underlying compute infrastructure on the fly depending on the load constraints.Document 6:::\nInference pipelines with the ONNX Runtime accelerator\n\nThe [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function makes it simple to use models from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)\nfor accelerated inference on a variety of tasks such as text classification, question answering and image classification.\n\n<Tip>\n\nYou can also use the\n[pipeline()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines) function from\nTransformers and provide your Optimum model class.\n\n</Tip>\n\nCurrently the supported tasks are:\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: How can I run a pipeline on a large model using 🤗 `accelerate`?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nTo run a pipeline on a large model using 🤗 `accelerate`, follow these steps:\n\n1.

Instead of creating a new message, we just replace the previously-created `None` message with the bot's response. Finally, we construct the message character by character and `yield` the intermediate outputs as they are being constructed. Gradio automatically turns any function with the `yield` keyword [into a streaming output interface](/guides/key-features/#iterative-outputs).\n\n3. The third method makes the input field interactive again so that users can send another message to the bot.\n\nOf course, in practice, you would replace `bot()` with your own more complex function, which might call a pretrained model or an API, to generate a response.Document 2:::\n$code_chatbot_simple\n\nThere are three Gradio components here:\n\n- A `Chatbot`, whose value stores the entire history of the conversation, as a list of response pairs between the user and bot.\n- A `Textbox` where the user can type their message, and then hit enter/submit to trigger the chatbot response\n- A `ClearButton` button to clear the Textbox and entire Chatbot history\n\nWe have a single function, `respond()`, which takes in the entire history of the chatbot, appends a random message, waits 1 second, and then returns the updated chat history. The `respond()` function also clears the textbox when it returns.Document 3:::\n## Using your chatbot via an API\n\nOnce you've built your Gradio chatbot and are hosting it on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space) or somewhere else, then you can query it with a simple API at the `/chat` endpoint.

This allows you to specify `None` as the second value in the tuple to add a single message from the bot side. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio import *\n\nbot_message = \"Hello, I'm the bot!\"\n\nwith Chatbot() as chatbot:\n    chatbot.update([(\"Hi, I'm DialoGPT.

We then create a new `Chatbot` object called `chatbot_output` and update it with the `user` function, which adds the user's message to the chat history. We also update it with the `bot` function, which adds a single message from the bot side by specifying `None` as the second value in the tuple. Finally, we launch the demo and display both chatbots side by side.",

            "2. The second method, `bot()` updates the chatbot history with the bot's response. Instead of creating a new message, we just replace the previously-created `None` message with the bot's response. Finally, we construct the message character by character and `yield` the intermediate outputs as they are being constructed. Gradio automatically turns any function with the `yield` keyword [into a streaming output interface](/guides/key-features/#iterative-outputs).\n\n3. The third method makes the input field interactive again so that users can send another message to the bot.\n\nOf course, in practice, you would replace `bot()` with your own more complex function, which might call a pretrained model or an API, to generate a response.",

For JSON files, there are two main formats to know about. The first one is called JSON Lines, where every row in the file is a separate JSON object. For these files, you can load the dataset by selecting the json loading script and pointing the data_files argument to the file or URL. In this example, we've loaded a JSON lines files based on Stack Exchange questions and answers.Document 1:::\nMetadata can also be specified as JSON Lines, in which case use `metadata.jsonl` as the name of the metadata file. This format is helpful in scenarios when one of the columns is complex, e.g. a list of floats, to avoid parsing errors or reading the complex values as strings.\n\nTo ignore the information in the metadata file, set `drop_metadata=True` in [`load_dataset`]:\n\n```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n>>> dataset = load_dataset(\"audiofolder\", data_dir=\"/path/to/folder\", drop_metadata=True)\n```Document 2:::\n```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n>>> dataset = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files=\"my_file.json\")\n```\n\nJSON files have diverse formats, but we think the most efficient format is to have multiple JSON objects; each line represents an individual row of data. For example:\n\n```json\n{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2.0, \"c\": \"foo\", \"d\": false}\n{\"a\": 4, \"b\": -5.5, \"c\": null, \"d\": true}\n```\n\nAnother JSON format you may encounter is a nested field, in which case you'll need to specify the `field` argument as shown in the following:Document 3:::\n</Tip>\n\nTo load a JSON file with the `load_dataset()` function, we just need to know if we're dealing with ordinary JSON (similar to a nested dictionary) or JSON Lines (line-separated JSON). Like many question answering datasets, SQuAD-it uses the nested format, with all the text stored in a `data` field.

This format is helpful in scenarios where one of the columns is complex, as it avoids parsing errors or reading complex values as strings. The format is line-separated JSON, and each row in the file is a separate JSON object. This format can be loaded into Hugging Face's `Datasets` library using the `json` loading script and pointing the `data_files` argument to the file or URL.",
        "retrieved_docs": [
            ". For JSON files, there are two main formats to know about. The first one is called JSON Lines, where every row in the file is a separate JSON object. For these files, you can load the dataset by selecting the json loading script and pointing the data_files argument to the file or URL. In this example, we've loaded a JSON lines files based on Stack Exchange questions and answers.",
            "Metadata can also be specified as JSON Lines, in which case use `metadata.jsonl` as the name of the metadata file. This format is helpful in scenarios when one of the columns is complex, e.g. a list of floats, to avoid parsing errors or reading the complex values as strings.\n\nTo ignore the information in the metadata file, set `drop_metadata=True` in [`load_dataset`]:\n\n```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n>>> dataset = load_dataset(\"audiofolder\", data_dir=\"/path/to/folder\", drop_metadata=True)\n```",
            "```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n>>> dataset = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files=\"my_file.json\")\n```\n\nJSON files have diverse formats, but we think the most efficient format is to have multiple JSON objects; each line represents an individual row of data. For example:\n\n```json\n{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2.0, \"c\": \"foo\", \"d\": false}\n{\"a\": 4, \"b\": -5.5, \"c\": null, \"d\": true}\n```\n\nAnother JSON format you may encounter is a nested field, in which case you'll need to specify the `field` argument as shown in the following:",
            "</Tip>\n\nTo load a JSON file with the `load_dataset()` function, we just need to know if we're dealing with ordinary JSON (similar to a nested dictionary) or JSON Lines (line-separated JSON). Like many question answering datasets, SQuAD-it uses the nested format, with all the text stored in a `data` field. This means we can load the dataset by specifying the `field` argument as follows:\n\n```py\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\nsquad_it_dataset = load_dataset(\"json\", data_files=\"SQuAD_it-train.json\", field=\"data\")\n```",

            "## Handling Files\n\nIf your component deals with files, these files **should** be uploaded to the backend server. \nThe `@gradio/client` npm package provides the `upload`, `prepare_files`, and `normalise_file` utility functions to help you do this.\n\nThe `prepare_files` function will convert the browser's `File` datatype to gradio's internal `FileData` type.\nYou should use the `FileData` data in your component to keep track of uploaded files.\n\nThe `upload` function will upload an array of `FileData` values to the server.\n\nThe `normalise_file` function will generate the correct URL for your component to fetch the file from and set it to the `data` property of the `FileData.`",
            "The component exposes a prop named `root`. \nThis is passed down by the parent gradio app and it represents the base url that the files will be uploaded to and fetched from.\n\nFor WASM support, you should get the upload function from the `Context` and pass that as the third parameter of the `upload` function.\n\n```typescript\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n    import { getContext } from \"svelte\";\n    const upload_fn = getContext<typeof upload_files>(\"upload_files\");\n\n    async function handle_upload(file_data: FileData[]): Promise<void> {\n        await tick();\n        await upload(file_data, root, upload_fn);\n    }\n</script>\n```",

            "A `data_model` defines the expected data format for your component, simplifying the component development process and self-documenting your code. It streamlines API usage and example caching.\n\n## Why is it important to use `FileData` for components dealing with file uploads?\n\nUtilizing `FileData` is crucial for components that expect file uploads. It ensures secure file handling, automatic caching, and streamlined client library functionality.\n\n## How can I add event triggers to my custom Gradio component?\n\nYou can define event triggers in the `EVENTS` class attribute by listing the desired event names, which automatically adds corresponding methods to your component.\n\n## Can I implement a custom Gradio component without defining a `data_model`?"

To fully align with the reference answer, it would need to definitively state that the Upload component accepts the filetype \"application/pdf\" without caveating or expressing uncertainty."

For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\"webcam\", \"upload\"]`).\n\n**Static and Interactive Components**Document 2:::\nYou can see examples of how web components look <a href=\"https://www.gradio.app\">on the Gradio landing page</a>.\n\nYou can also customize the appearance and behavior of your web component with attributes that you pass into the `<gradio-app>` tag:Document 3:::\nYou can access each of the components of the pipeline as an attribute to view its configuration:Document 4:::\nLet's take a closer look at these components used to provide input and output.\n\n## Components Attributes\n\nWe used the default versions of the `gr.Textbox` and `gr.Slider`, but what if you want to change how the UI components look or behave?\n\nLet's say you want to customize the slider to have values from 1 to 10, with a default of 2. And you wanted to customize the output text field — you want it to be larger and have a label.\n\nIf you use the actual class for `gr.Textbox` and `gr.Slider` instead of using the string shortcut, you have access to much more customizability through component attributes.\n\n$code_hello_world_2\n$demo_hello_world_2\n\n## Multiple Input and Output ComponentsDocument 5:::\nGradio Components: The Key Concepts\n\nIn this section, we discuss a few important concepts when it comes to components in Gradio.\nIt's important to understand these concepts when developing your own component.\nOtherwise, your component may behave very different to other Gradio components!\n\nTip:  You can skip this section if you are familiar with the internals of the Gradio library, such as each component's preprocess and postprocess methods.\n\n## Interactive vs StaticDocument 6:::\n- [#6014](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/6014) [`cad537aac`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/cad537aac57998560c9f44a37499be734de66349) - pass props to example components and to example outputs. Thanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)!\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is the attribute of a component that is passed around quite a bit?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nThe attribute of a component that is passed around quite a bit is the value. Every component has a value, which is typically set by the user in the frontend (if the component is interactive) or displayed to the user (if it is static).

            "## The value and how it is preprocessed/postprocessed\n\nThe most important attribute of a component is its `value`.\nEvery component has a `value`.\nThe value that is typically set by the user in the frontend (if the component is interactive) or displayed to the user (if it is static). \nIt is also this value that is sent to the backend function when a user triggers an event, or returned by the user's function e.g. at the end of a prediction.\n\nSo this value is passed around quite a bit, but sometimes the format of the value needs to change between the frontend and backend. \nTake a look at this example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr",
            "Each component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\"webcam\", \"upload\"]`).\n\n**Static and Interactive Components**",
            "You can see examples of how web components look <a href=\"https://www.gradio.app\">on the Gradio landing page</a>.\n\nYou can also customize the appearance and behavior of your web component with attributes that you pass into the `<gradio-app>` tag:",
            "You can access each of the components of the pipeline as an attribute to view its configuration:",
            "Let's take a closer look at these components used to provide input and output.\n\n## Components Attributes\n\nWe used the default versions of the `gr.Textbox` and `gr.Slider`, but what if you want to change how the UI components look or behave?\n\nLet's say you want to customize the slider to have values from 1 to 10, with a default of 2. And you wanted to customize the output text field — you want it to be larger and have a label.\n\nIf you use the actual class for `gr.Textbox` and `gr.Slider` instead of using the string shortcut, you have access to much more customizability through component attributes.\n\n$code_hello_world_2\n$demo_hello_world_2\n\n## Multiple Input and Output Components",
            "Gradio Components: The Key Concepts\n\nIn this section, we discuss a few important concepts when it comes to components in Gradio.\nIt's important to understand these concepts when developing your own component.\nOtherwise, your component may behave very different to other Gradio components!\n\nTip:  You can skip this section if you are familiar with the internals of the Gradio library, such as each component's preprocess and postprocess methods.\n\n## Interactive vs Static",

Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\n# Define the Textbox outside of the Blocks() scope\nmy_textbox = gr.Textbox()\n\n# Use the Textbox in another function or block\ndef greet():\n    name = my_textbox.value\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n# Create a Blocks interface with the Textbox and the greeting function\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    demo.update(visible=False)\n    demo.launch(share=False)\n    demo.refresh()\n    demo.update(visible=True)\n    demo.refresh()\n    demo.update(**{\"my_textbox\": my_textbox})\n    demo.refresh()\n    demo.update(**{\"greet\": greet})\n    demo.refresh()\n```\n\nIn this example, we first create a new instance of the Textbox component outside of the `Blocks()` scope. We then define a greeting function that uses the value of the Textbox. We create a new `Blocks()` interface and update it with the Textbox and the greeting function. We also set the interface to be invisible and launch it without sharing. We then update the interface to make it visible and refresh it to display the changes. This allows us to define components outside of the `Blocks()` scope and use them in other functions or blocks within Gradio.",

JAX uses just-in-time (jit) compilation of JAX Python functions so it can be executed efficiently in XLA. In order to get the best performance, we must use static shapes for jitted functions, this is because JAX transforms work by tracing a function and to determine its effect on inputs of a specific shape and type. When a new shape is introduced to an already compiled function, it retriggers compilation on the new shape, which can greatly reduce performance. **Note**: JIT compilation is particularly well-suited for text-to-image generation because all inputs and outputs (image input / output sizes) are static.Document 2:::\nIn JAX, most transformations (notably `jax.jit`) require functions that are transformed to be stateless so that they have no side effects. This is because any such side-effects will only be executed once when the transformed function is run during compilation and all subsequent calls of the compiled function would re-use the same side-effects of the compiled run instead of the \"actual\" side-effects (see [Stateful Computations in JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/07-state.html)).

Blocks automatically figures out whether a component should be interactive (accept user input) or not, based on the event triggers you define. In our example, the first textbox is interactive, since its value is used by the `flip_text()` function. The second textbox is not interactive, since its value is never used as an input.

            "4. Blocks automatically figures out whether a component should be interactive (accept user input) or not, based on the event triggers you define. In our example, the first textbox is interactive, since its value is used by the `flip_text()` function. The second textbox is not interactive, since its value is never used as an input. In some cases, you might want to override this, which you can do by passing a boolean to the `interactive` parameter of the component (e.g. `gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"Flip this text\", interactive=True)`).\n\n### Customizing the layout of your demo[[customizing-the-layout-of-your-demo]]",

It is called a latent diffusion model because it works with a lower-dimensional representation of the image instead of the actual pixel space, which makes it more memory efficient. The encoder compresses the image into a smaller representation, and a decoder to convert the compressed representation back into an image. For text-to-image models, you'll need a tokenizer and an encoder to generate text embeddings. From the previous example, you already know you need a UNet model and a scheduler.\n\nAs you can see, this is already more complex than the DDPM pipeline which only contains a UNet model.

Based on the provided context, we know that Stable Diffusion uses quantization techniques to reduce model size and improve efficiency on-device. Specifically, the text mentions 6-bit palettization and mixed-bit quantization, both of which have been successfully applied to Stable Diffusion models. However, the question does not specify which of these techniques is used in Stable Diffusion. Without further information, it is unclear which technique is being referred to. If the context provided additional details or clarification, it may be possible to determine which quantization technique is being referred to. However, as the context does not provide this information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question.

The latest versions of Core ML and `coremltools` support techniques like 6-bit palettization that are easy to apply and that have a minimal impact on quality. We have added 6-bit palettized [models to the Hub](https://huggingface.co/apple), which are small enough to run on both iOS and macOS. We've also shown how you can convert fine-tuned models yourself, and can't wait to see what you do with these tools and techniques!",

Stable Diffusion was trained mainly on the English subset of LAION-5B and can generate high-performance images simply by entering text prompts. In addition to its high performance, Stable Diffusion is also easy to use with inference running at a computing cost of about 10GB VRAM GPU.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/stable_diffusion.png\" alt=\"sd-pipeline\" width=\"300\"/>\n</p>",

It is called a latent diffusion model because it works with a lower-dimensional representation of the image instead of the actual pixel space, which makes it more memory efficient. The encoder compresses the image into a smaller representation, and a decoder to convert the compressed representation back into an image. For text-to-image models, you'll need a tokenizer and an encoder to generate text embeddings. From the previous example, you already know you need a UNet model and a scheduler.\n\nAs you can see, this is already more complex than the DDPM pipeline which only contains a UNet model. The Stable Diffusion model has three separate pretrained models.\n\n<Tip>"

Gap between ML in basic research and education and ML in finance - Due to the regulated nature of the finance industry, we see limited exchange of ideas, data, and resources between the basic research and the finance sector, in the area of ML. There are few exceptions of course. This has led to scarcity of developing ML research that cater to the needs of the finance industry. I think more efforts must be made to decrease this gap. Otherwise, it will be increasingly challenging for the finance industry to leverage the latest ML advances.Document 1:::\nOne of the key useful traits of ML is that it can learn from and find hidden patterns in large volumes of data. With a focus on digitization, the financial sector is producing digital data more than ever, which makes it challenging for humans to comprehend, process and make decisions. ML is enabling humans in making sense of the data, glean information from them, and make well-informed decisions. At Moody's Analytics, we are using ML and helping our clients to better manage risk and meet business and industry demands.Document 2:::\nTo maximize the benefits of ML there is a double challenge of delivering value to users that are new to machine learning and also to seasoned data scientists. There's obviously a huge difference in demands for these two folks. If an ML capability is a total black box it's likely to be too rigid or simple to have a real impact. On the other hand, if you solely deliver a developer toolkit it's only useful if you have a data science team in-house. Striking the right balance is about making sure ML is open enough for the data science team to have transparency and control over models and also packing in battle-tested models that are easy to configure and deploy without being a pro.Document 3:::\n#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\nThe finance and banking industry brings a lot of challenges due to the nature of the industry. First of all, it is a highly regulated industry with government oversight in many aspects. The data that is often used is very personal and identifiable data (social security numbers, bank statements, tax records, etc). Hence there is a lot of care taken to create machine learning and AI models that are private and unbiased. Many government regulations require any models to be explainable. For example, if a loan is denied, there is a fundamental need to explain why it is denied.Document 4:::\n#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\n1. Reducing the False Positives without impacting the True Positives  - A number of applications using ML in the regtech space rely on alerts. With strict regulatory measures and big financial implications of a wrong decision, human investigations can be time consuming and demanding. ML certainly helps in these scenarios in assisting human analysts to arrive at the right decisions. But if a ML system results in a lot of False Positives, it makes an analysts' job harder. Coming up with the right balance is an important challenge for ML in finance.Document 5:::\n#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on finance?**\nMachine learning (ML) has made a significant positive impact in the finance industry in many ways.

            "2. Gap between ML in basic research and education and ML in finance - Due to the regulated nature of the finance industry, we see limited exchange of ideas, data, and resources between the basic research and the finance sector, in the area of ML. There are few exceptions of course. This has led to scarcity of developing ML research that cater to the needs of the finance industry. I think more efforts must be made to decrease this gap. Otherwise, it will be increasingly challenging for the finance industry to leverage the latest ML advances.",
            "One of the key useful traits of ML is that it can learn from and find hidden patterns in large volumes of data. With a focus on digitization, the financial sector is producing digital data more than ever, which makes it challenging for humans to comprehend, process and make decisions. ML is enabling humans in making sense of the data, glean information from them, and make well-informed decisions. At Moody's Analytics, we are using ML and helping our clients to better manage risk and meet business and industry demands.",
            "To maximize the benefits of ML there is a double challenge of delivering value to users that are new to machine learning and also to seasoned data scientists. There's obviously a huge difference in demands for these two folks. If an ML capability is a total black box it's likely to be too rigid or simple to have a real impact. On the other hand, if you solely deliver a developer toolkit it's only useful if you have a data science team in-house. Striking the right balance is about making sure ML is open enough for the data science team to have transparency and control over models and also packing in battle-tested models that are easy to configure and deploy without being a pro.",
            "#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\nThe finance and banking industry brings a lot of challenges due to the nature of the industry. First of all, it is a highly regulated industry with government oversight in many aspects. The data that is often used is very personal and identifiable data (social security numbers, bank statements, tax records, etc). Hence there is a lot of care taken to create machine learning and AI models that are private and unbiased. Many government regulations require any models to be explainable. For example, if a loan is denied, there is a fundamental need to explain why it is denied.",
            "#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\n1. Reducing the False Positives without impacting the True Positives  - A number of applications using ML in the regtech space rely on alerts. With strict regulatory measures and big financial implications of a wrong decision, human investigations can be time consuming and demanding. ML certainly helps in these scenarios in assisting human analysts to arrive at the right decisions. But if a ML system results in a lot of False Positives, it makes an analysts' job harder.

A lower score is better. (Documents 0, 1, and 2)\n\nExplanation:\n\nPerplexity is a metric used to evaluate the performance of language models. It measures how likely the model is to generate a given input text sequence. The lower the perplexity score, the better the model's performance. The range of the perplexity metric is from 0 to infinity, where a score of 0 indicates perfect prediction and a score of infinity indicates complete uncertainty. Therefore, a lower perplexity score is preferred as it indicates that the model is more confident in generating the input text sequence.

We build an agent that learns from the environment **by interacting with it through trial and error** and receiving rewards (negative or positive) as feedback.\n- The goal of any RL agent is to maximize its expected cumulative reward (also called expected return) because RL is based on the **reward hypothesis**, which is that **all goals can be described as the maximization of the expected cumulative reward.**\n- The RL process is a loop that outputs a sequence of **state, action, reward and next state.**\n- To calculate the expected cumulative reward (expected return), we discount the rewards: the rewards that come sooner (at the beginning of the game) **are more probable to happen since they are more predictable than the long term future reward.**"

Import the required modules:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   import timm\n   ```\n\n2. Create the model with the `features_only` argument set to `True`:\n\n   ```python\n   m = timm.create_model('regnety_032', features_only=True, pretrained=True)\n   ```\n\n   Here, replace 'regnety_032' with the name of the model you want to use.\n\n3. Pass an input tensor through the model to extract the feature maps:\n\n   ```python\n   o = m(torch.randn(2, 3, 224, 224))\n   ```\n\n4. Iterate over the output tensor to access the feature maps:\n\n   ```python\n   for x in o:\n       print(x.shape)\n   ```\n\n   This will print the shapes of the feature maps at each level.\n\n   Note that the number of feature maps and their strides may vary depending on the model. By default, timm outputs 5 feature maps with the first starting at stride 2.\n\n   You can also specify the output indices and output stride using the `out_indices` and `output_stride` arguments, respectively, when creating the model:\n\n   ```python\n   m = timm.create_model('regnety_032', features_only=True, out_indices=(2, 4), output_stride=4)\n   ```\n\n   This will extract feature maps at strides 4 and 8 (i.e., levels 2 and 4) using the RegNetY-032 model.\n\n   Alternatively, you can query the feature information using the `.feature_info` attribute:\n\n   ```python\n   print(m.feature_info.channels())\n   ```\n\n   This will print the number of channels at each level.\n\n   You can also access the feature maps directly using the `feature_maps` attribute of the output tensor:\n\n   ```python\n   inputs = processor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n   outputs = model(**inputs)\n",

The last ROUGE variant we'll discuss is ROUGE-L. ROUGE-L doesn't compare n-grams, but instead treats each summary as a sequence of words and then looks for the longest common subsequence or LCS. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. So in this example, \"I loved reading the Hunger Games\" is the longest common subsequence. The main advantage of ROUGE-L over ROUGE-1 or ROUGE-2 is that is doesn't depend on consecutive n-gram matches, so it tends to capture sentence structure more accuratelyDocument 1:::\n. To compute ROUGE scores in Hugging Face Datasets is very simple: just use the load_metric() function, provide your model's summaries along with the references and you're good to go! The output from the calculation contains a lot of information! The first thing we can see here is that the confidence intervals of each ROUGE score are provided in the low, mid, and high fields.

We've already seen ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L, so what is ROUGE-LSUM?

            "## A flexible approach: helpers\n\nThe first approach to integrate a library to the Hub is to actually implement the `push_to_hub` and `from_pretrained`\nmethods by yourself. This gives you full flexibility on which files you need to upload/download and how to handle inputs\nspecific to your framework. You can refer to the two [upload files](./upload) and [download files](./download) guides\nto learn more about how to do that. This is, for example how the FastAI integration is implemented (see [`push_to_hub_fastai`]\nand [`from_pretrained_fastai`]).\n\nImplementation can differ between libraries, but the workflow is often similar.\n\n### from_pretrained",
            "There are four main ways to integrate a library with the Hub:\n1. **Push to Hub:** implement a method to upload a model to the Hub.

This method is often called `push_to_hub()`.\n2. **Download from Hub:** implement a method to load a model from the Hub. The method should download the model\n   configuration/weights and load the model. This method is often called `from_pretrained` or `load_from_hub()`.",
            "## A more complex approach: class inheritance\n\nAs we saw above, there are two main methods to include in your library to integrate it with the Hub: upload files\n(`push_to_hub`) and download files (`from_pretrained`). You can implement those methods by yourself but it comes with\ncaveats. To tackle this, `huggingface_hub` provides a tool that uses class inheritance. Let's see how it works!"

You can install the dependencies either with the prepared Dockerfiles provided in the links or by following the instructions in `torch_ort` (Document 0) or `torch_ort` (Document 1).\n\n2. By default, ONNX Runtime runs inference on CPU devices. To use the GPU, you can use the `CUDAExecutionProvider` or `TensorrtExecutionProvider` for NVIDIA GPUs, as explained in Document 3.\n\n3. To use ONNX Runtime backend for inference, you can add the flag `--inference_with_ort` while running the inference, as mentioned in Documents 0 and 1.\n\n4. If you want to optimize or quantize your model for ONNX Runtime, you can use the `ORTOptimizer` and `ORTQuantizer`, as explained in Document 2.\n\n5. For sequence-to-sequence models, ONNX Runtime decomposes them into three parts during inference, as explained in Document 4.\n\n6. You can use the `pipeline()` function from Transformers to run accelerated inference without rewriting your APIs, as explained in Document 6. The `optimum.onnxruntime.ORTModelForXXX` model classes are API compatible with Hugging Face Transformers models, so you can replace your `AutoModelForXXX` class with the corresponding `ORTModelForXXX` class in `optimum.onnxruntime`.\n\n7.

Again, -100 indicates the labels that should be ignored for the loss computation. This is all done for us by the DataCollatorForTokenClassification, which you can use in PyTorch or TensorFlow. With all of this, you are either ready to send your data and this data collator to the Trainer, or to use the to_tf_dataset method and use the fit method of your model.Document 1:::\nIn addition, we must make sure that padding token id's of the `labels` are not taken into account by the loss\nfunction. In PyTorch and Tensorflow, this can be done by replacing them with -100, which is the `ignore_index`\nof the `CrossEntropyLoss`. In Flax, one can use the `decoder_attention_mask` to ignore padded tokens from\nthe loss (see the [Flax summarization script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/flax/summarization) for details). We also pass\n`attention_mask` as additional input to the model, which makes sure that padding tokens of the inputs are\nignored. The code example below illustrates all of this.Document 2:::\nexplain: \"That's not specific to token classification -- we always use <code>-100</code> as the label for tokens we want to ignore in the loss.\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"We need to make sure to truncate or pad the labels to the same size as the inputs, when applying truncation/padding.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"Indeed! That's not the only difference, though.\",\n\t\t\tcorrect: true\n\t\t}\n\t]}\n/>Document 3:::\nWith 🤗 Transformers, we can simply pass the `input_ids` as the `labels` to our model, and the average negative\nlog-likelihood for each token is returned as the loss. With our sliding window approach, however, there is overlap in\nthe tokens we pass to the model at each iteration. We don't want the log-likelihood for the tokens we're just treating\nas context to be included in our loss, so we can set these targets to `-100` so that they are ignored. The following\nis an example of how we could do this with a stride of `512`. This means that the model will have at least 512 tokens\nfor context when calculating the conditional likelihood of any one token (provided there are 512 preceding tokens\navailable to condition on).\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom tqdm import tqdmDocument 4:::\n### Data collation[[data-collation]]\n\nWe can't just use a `DataCollatorWithPadding` like in [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3) because that only pads the inputs (input IDs, attention mask, and token type IDs). Here our labels should be padded the exact same way as the inputs so that they stay the same size, using `-100` as a value so that the corresponding predictions are ignored in the loss computation.\n\nThis is all done by a [`DataCollatorForTokenClassification`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/data_collator.html#datacollatorfortokenclassification). Like the `DataCollatorWithPadding`, it takes the `tokenizer` used to preprocess the inputs:Document 5:::\n```py\ninputs.word_ids()\n```\n\n```python out\n[None, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, None]\n```\n\nWith a tiny bit of work, we can then expand our label list to match the tokens. The first rule we'll apply is that special tokens get a label of `-100`. This is because by default `-100` is an index that is ignored in the loss function we will use (cross entropy). Then, each token gets the same label as the token that started the word it's inside, since they are part of the same entity. For tokens inside a word but not at the beginning, we replace the `B-` with `I-` (since the token does not begin the entity):Document 6:::\n. Then comes the hard part. Since we have added special tokens and each word may have been split into several tokens, our labels won't match the tokens anymore. This is where the word IDs our fast tokenizer provide come to the rescue. They match each token to the word it belongs to which allows us to map each token to its label. We just have to make sure we change the B- labels to their I- counterparts for tokens that are inside (but not at the beginning) of a word. The special tokens get a label of -100, which is how we tell the Transformer loss functions to ignore them when computing the loss\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is the label for tokens that should be ignored for the loss computation?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nThe label for tokens that should be ignored for the loss computation is -100. This is mentioned in Document 1 and explained in Document 3. In PyTorch and TensorFlow, this is achieved by replacing the padding token IDs with -100, which is the ignore_index of the CrossEntropyLoss. In Flax, the decoder_attention_mask is used to ignore padded tokens from the loss. This is necessary to ensure that padding tokens of the inputs and labels are ignored during the loss computation.",
        "retrieved_docs": [
            ". Again, -100 indicates the labels that should be ignored for the loss computation. This is all done for us by the DataCollatorForTokenClassification, which you can use in PyTorch or TensorFlow. With all of this, you are either ready to send your data and this data collator to the Trainer, or to use the to_tf_dataset method and use the fit method of your model.",
            "In addition, we must make sure that padding token id's of the `labels` are not taken into account by the loss\nfunction. In PyTorch and Tensorflow, this can be done by replacing them with -100, which is the `ignore_index`\nof the `CrossEntropyLoss`. In Flax, one can use the `decoder_attention_mask` to ignore padded tokens from\nthe loss (see the [Flax summarization script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/flax/summarization) for details). We also pass\n`attention_mask` as additional input to the model, which makes sure that padding tokens of the inputs are\nignored. The code example below illustrates all of this.",
            "explain: \"That's not specific to token classification -- we always use <code>-100</code> as the label for tokens we want to ignore in the loss.\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"We need to make sure to truncate or pad the labels to the same size as the inputs, when applying truncation/padding.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"Indeed! That's not the only difference, though.\",\n\t\t\tcorrect: true\n\t\t}\n\t]}\n/>",
            "With 🤗 Transformers, we can simply pass the `input_ids` as the `labels` to our model, and the average negative\nlog-likelihood for each token is returned as the loss. With our sliding window approach, however, there is overlap in\nthe tokens we pass to the model at each iteration. We don't want the log-likelihood for the tokens we're just treating\nas context to be included in our loss, so we can set these targets to `-100` so that they are ignored. The following\nis an example of how we could do this with a stride of `512`. This means that the model will have at least 512 tokens\nfor context when calculating the conditional likelihood of any one token (provided there are 512 preceding tokens\navailable to condition on).\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom tqdm import tqdm",
            "### Data collation[[data-collation]]\n\nWe can't just use a `DataCollatorWithPadding` like in [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3) because that only pads the inputs (input IDs, attention mask, and token type IDs). Here our labels should be padded the exact same way as the inputs so that they stay the same size, using `-100` as a value so that the corresponding predictions are ignored in the loss computation.\n\nThis is all done by a [`DataCollatorForTokenClassification`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/data_collator.html#datacollatorfortokenclassification). Like the `DataCollatorWithPadding`, it takes the `tokenizer` used to preprocess the inputs:",
            "```py\ninputs.word_ids()\n```\n\n```python out\n[None, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, None]\n```\n\nWith a tiny bit of work, we can then expand our label list to match the tokens. The first rule we'll apply is that special tokens get a label of `-100`. This is because by default `-100` is an index that is ignored in the loss function we will use (cross entropy). Then, each token gets the same label as the token that started the word it's inside, since they are part of the same entity. For tokens inside a word but not at the beginning, we replace the `B-` with `I-` (since the token does not begin the entity):",
            ". Then comes the hard part. Since we have added special tokens and each word may have been split into several tokens, our labels won't match the tokens anymore. This is where the word IDs our fast tokenizer provide come to the rescue. They match each token to the word it belongs to which allows us to map each token to its label. We just have to make sure we change the B- labels to their I- counterparts for tokens that are inside (but not at the beginning) of a word. The special tokens get a label of -100, which is how we tell the Transformer loss functions to ignore them when computing the loss"

Simple, we just pick the biggest probability for each output! The easiest way to do that is with the argmax function. Argmax will return the index of the largest probability in each row, which means in this case that we’ll get a vector of 0 and 1 values. Those are our class predictions!

However, they also report a higher human performance Exact Match score of 80.3%. This information can be found in the \"Values from Popular Papers\" section of Document 3 as well. In Document 4, the exact match metric is also included, and the original SQuAD paper reports an Exact Match score of 40.0% for their model.

In Document 5, the `squad` metric is used to compute the exact match score, and the output dictionary includes both the exact match score and the F1 score. The range of the exact match score is 0-100, where 100.0 means all answers were matched. In Document 6, limitations and bias of using the exact match score are discussed, including the fact that the SQuAD dataset contains some noise but that carrying out more in-depth error analysis can complement these scores.

We want to pad our examples to the longest sentence in the batch, which is done by the `DataCollatorWithPadding` collator.

This data collator is needed because CTC models require input sequences to be padded to a fixed length, and the DataCollatorCTCWithPadding class ensures that all input sequences are padded to the same length before being passed to the model during training. This is achieved by selecting a padding strategy, which can be specified as a boolean, string, or PaddingStrategy object, and passed to the DataCollatorCTCWithPadding class as an argument.

            "```py\nfrom peft import LoraConfig\n\nconfig = LoraConfig(\n    lora_alpha=16,\n    lora_dropout=0.1,\n    r=64,\n    bias=\"none\",\n    task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\"\n)\nmodel.add_adapter(peft_config)\n```\n\nNow you can train the model with Transformer's [`~transformers.Trainer`] class or whichever training framework you prefer.\n\nTo use the newly trained model for inference, the [`~transformers.AutoModel`] class uses PEFT on the backend to load the adapter weights and configuration file into a base pretrained model.\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM",
            "## Transformers\n\nTransformers is a collection of pretrained models for all types of tasks in all modalities. You can load these models for training or inference. Many of the models are large language models (LLMs), so it makes sense to integrate PEFT with Transformers to manage and train adapters.\n\nLoad a base pretrained model to train.\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-350m\")\n```\n\nNext, add an adapter configuration to specify how to adapt the model parameters. Call the [`~PeftModel.add_adapter`] method to add the configuration to the base model.\n\n```py\nfrom peft import LoraConfig",
            "1. Instantiate a base model.\n2. Create a configuration (`IA3Config`) where you define IA3-specific parameters.\n3. Wrap the base model with `get_peft_model()` to get a trainable `PeftModel`.\n4. Train the `PeftModel` as you normally would train the base model.\n\n`IA3Config` allows you to control how IA3 is applied to the base model through the following parameters:",
            "You're almost ready to setup your model and start training!\n\nInitialize a base model from [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM`], and pass it and `peft_config` to the [`get_peft_model`] function to create a [`PeftModel`]. You can print the new [`PeftModel`]'s trainable parameters to see how much more efficient it is than training the full parameters of the original model!"

It delivers some heavy firepower out of the box with an amalgamation of different techniques like time series decomposition, clustering, correlation analysis, and Bayesian distribution modeling. The big benefit for security analysts is threat detection is automated in many different ways. So anomalies are quickly bubbled up related to temporal deviations, unusual geographic locations, statistical rarity, and many other factors. That's the huge positive impact of integrating ML. \n \n#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within SaaS?**Document 1:::\n#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on SaaS?**\nMachine learning has become truly operational in SaaS, powering multiple uses from personalization, semantic and image search, recommendations to anomaly detection, and a ton of other business scenarios. The real impact is that ML comes baked right into more and more applications. It's becoming an expectation and more often than not it's invisible to end users.Document 2:::\nFor these reasons, we’ve tapped into this unique group of ML Directors for a series of articles highlighting their thoughts on current ML insights and industry trends ranging from Healthcare to Finance, eCommerce, SaaS, Research, Media, and more. For example, one Director will note how ML can be used to reduce empty deadheading truck driving (which occurs ~20% of the time) down to just 19% would cut carbon emissions by ~100,000 Americans. Note: This is back of napkin math, done by an ex-rocket Scientist however, so we’ll take it.Document 3:::\n#### **3. What’s a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into a SaaS product?**\nNot giving users the flexibility to incorporate their business knowledge or other human factors that are critical to business success. For example, for a self-serve product recommendation, it would be great if users could control the diversity of recommended products.\n \n#### **4. What excites you most about the future of ML?**\nML has seen tremendous success. It also evolves rapidly to address the current limitations (e.g., lack of data, domain shift, incorporation of domain knowledge).\n\nMore ML technologies will be applied to solve business or customer needs. For example, interpretable ML for users to understand and trust the ML model outputs; counterfactual prediction for users to estimate the alternative outcome should they make a different business decision.Document 4:::\n#### **3. What’s a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into SaaS?**\nIs my solution the smartest solution? Is there a better way to break this down and solve it more efficiently? \n\nWhen we started identifying speakers we went directly with an ML method and this wasn’t as accurate as the video conference provider data. \n\nSince then we learned that the best way to do this is to start with the metadata of who speaks from the conference provider and then overlay that with a smart embedding model.

This is an example of a SaaS company that has integrated ML for anomaly detection. (Source: Document 0)",
        "retrieved_docs": [
            "For example, at Elastic we invested in ML for anomaly detection, optimized for endpoint security and SIEM. It delivers some heavy firepower out of the box with an amalgamation of different techniques like time series decomposition, clustering, correlation analysis, and Bayesian distribution modeling. The big benefit for security analysts is threat detection is automated in many different ways. So anomalies are quickly bubbled up related to temporal deviations, unusual geographic locations, statistical rarity, and many other factors. That's the huge positive impact of integrating ML. \n \n#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within SaaS?**",
            "#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on SaaS?**\nMachine learning has become truly operational in SaaS, powering multiple uses from personalization, semantic and image search, recommendations to anomaly detection, and a ton of other business scenarios. The real impact is that ML comes baked right into more and more applications. It's becoming an expectation and more often than not it's invisible to end users.",
            "For these reasons, we’ve tapped into this unique group of ML Directors for a series of articles highlighting their thoughts on current ML insights and industry trends ranging from Healthcare to Finance, eCommerce, SaaS, Research, Media, and more. For example, one Director will note how ML can be used to reduce empty deadheading truck driving (which occurs ~20% of the time) down to just 19% would cut carbon emissions by ~100,000 Americans. Note: This is back of napkin math, done by an ex-rocket Scientist however, so we’ll take it.",
            "#### **3. What’s a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into a SaaS product?**\nNot giving users the flexibility to incorporate their business knowledge or other human factors that are critical to business success. For example, for a self-serve product recommendation, it would be great if users could control the diversity of recommended products.\n \n#### **4. What excites you most about the future of ML?**\nML has seen tremendous success. It also evolves rapidly to address the current limitations (e.g., lack of data, domain shift, incorporation of domain knowledge).\n\nMore ML technologies will be applied to solve business or customer needs. For example, interpretable ML for users to understand and trust the ML model outputs; counterfactual prediction for users to estimate the alternative outcome should they make a different business decision.",
            "#### **3. What’s a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into SaaS?**\nIs my solution the smartest solution? Is there a better way to break this down and solve it more efficiently? \n\nWhen we started identifying speakers we went directly with an ML method and this wasn’t as accurate as the video conference provider data. \n\nSince then we learned that the best way to do this is to start with the metadata of who speaks from the conference provider and then overlay that with a smart embedding model. We lost precious time during this learning curve. We shouldn’t have used this large ML solution if we stopped to understand there are other data sources we should invest in that will help us accelerate more efficiently.",

The resulting answer(s) can be a region in the table, or a number calculated by applying aggregation operators to a specific region.\n\n### What Questions Can be AnsweredDocument 1:::\n1. SQA: if you're interested in asking follow-up questions related to a table, in a conversational set-up.

Based on the context provided, we can see that the config class for XLMRoberta is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the config class for XLMRoberta is called `XLMRobertaConfig` based on the naming convention used for other config classes in the Hugging Face Transformers library. Here's how we can arrive at this conclusion:\n\n- In documents 0, 2, and 3, we see that there are several classes that inherit from `XLMRobertaConfig`, such as `XLMRobertaXLForCausalLMConfig`, `XLMRobertaXLForMaskedLMConfig`, `XLMRobertaXLForSequenceClassificationConfig`, `XLMRobertaXLForMultipleChoiceConfig`, `XLMRobertaForTokenClassificationConfig`, and `XLMRobertaForQuestionAnsweringConfig`.\n- In document 4, we see that there is a class called `XLMRobertaTokenizer`, which does not inherit from `XLMRobertaConfig`. However, in document 5, we see that there is a class called `XLMRobertaXLForTokenClassification`, which does inherit from `XLMRobertaConfig`. This suggests that `XLMRobertaConfig` is a base class for all XLMRoberta-specific configuration classes.\n- In document 6, we see that there is a class called `XLMRobertaForMultipleChoice`, which does not inherit from `XLMRobertaConfig`. However, we also see that there is an example script and notebook provided for using `XLMRobertaForMultipleChoice`. This suggests that `XLMRobertaForMultipleChoice` is a pre-trained model that uses the XLMRoberta architecture, and that its configuration is inherited from `XLMRobertaConfig`.\n\nBased on this evidence, we can conclude that the config class for XLMRoberta is called `XLMRobertaConfig`.",

While selecting the best action to take for the next state, we use our DQN network, which estimates the Q values for all possible actions. However, to calculate the target Q value of taking that action at the next state, we use a separate network with fixed parameters, called the Target network. By doing so, we decouple the action selection process from the target Q value generation process, which helps to reduce the overestimation of Q values. This is because the Target network is updated less frequently than the DQN network, which prevents the Target network from overestimating the Q values due to the recent updates in the DQN network. The parameters of the Target network are copied from the DQN network every C steps, which is called target network update. This approach helps to train faster and have more stable learning in Deep Q-Learning.",

Red-teaming shares some similarities and differences with the more well-known form of evaluation in ML called *adversarial attacks*. The similarity is that both red-teaming and adversarial attacks share the same goal of “attacking” or “fooling” the model to generate content that would be undesirable in a real-world use case. However, adversarial attacks can be unintelligible to humans, for example, by prefixing the string “aaabbbcc” to each prompt because it deteriorates model performance. Many examples of such attacks on various NLP classification and generation tasks is discussed  in [Wallace et al., ‘19](https://arxivDocument 1:::\n.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) of generative models makes it hard to reproduce failure cases. Red-teaming gives actionable insights into model limitations and can be used to add guardrails and document model limitations. There are currently no red-teaming benchmarks or leaderboards highlighting the need for more work in open source red-teaming resources. [Anthropic's red-teaming dataset](https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf/tree/master/red-team-attempts) is the only open source resource of red-teaming prompts, but is limited to only English natural language text.Document 2:::\n**Red-teaming:** ['Red-teaming'](https://huggingface.co/blog/red-teaming) consists of stress testing AI models for potential vulnerabilities, biases, and weaknesses by prompting them and analyzing results. While it has been employed in practice for evaluating language models (including the upcoming [Generative AI Red Teaming event at DEFCON](https://aivillage.org/generative%20red%20team/generative-red-team/), which we are participating in), there are no established and systematic ways of red-teaming AI models and it remains relatively ad hoc. In fact, there are so many potential types of failure modes and biases in AI models, it is hard to anticipate them all, and the [stochastic nature](https://dlDocument 3:::\n- [Training a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862) (Anthropic, 2022): A detailed documentation of training a LM assistant with RLHF.\n- [Red Teaming Language Models to Reduce Harms: Methods, Scaling Behaviors, and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07858) (Ganguli et al. 2022): A detailed documentation of efforts to “discover, measure, and attempt to reduce [language models] potentially harmful outputs.”Document 4:::\nRed-teaming can reveal model limitations that can cause upsetting user experiences or enable harm by aiding violence or other unlawful activity for a user with malicious intentions.

Coming up with red-teaming prompts for models that are fine-tuned for safety and alignment (such as via RLHF or SFT) requires creative thinking in the form of *roleplay attacks* wherein the LLM is instructed to behave as a malicious character [as in Ganguli et al., ‘22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07858.pdf). Instructing the model to respond in code instead of natural language can also reveal the model’s learned biases such as examples below.\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is the goal of red-teaming language models?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nThe goal of red-teaming language models is to identify potential vulnerabilities, biases, and weaknesses in AI models, specifically language models, by prompting them and analyzing their outputs. The insights gained through red-teaming can help add guardrails and document model limitations, ultimately reducing the likelihood of upsetting user experiences or enabling harm by aiding violence or other unlawful activity for a user with malicious intentions. Red-teaming shares some similarities with adversarial attacks, but red-teaming prompts are designed to be more intelligible to humans and can reveal model limitations that are specific to safety and alignment, such as through roleplay attacks or instructing the model to respond in code.",

            "The goal of red-teaming language models is to craft a prompt that would trigger the model to generate text that is likely to cause harm. Red-teaming shares some similarities and differences with the more well-known form of evaluation in ML called *adversarial attacks*. The similarity is that both red-teaming and adversarial attacks share the same goal of “attacking” or “fooling” the model to generate content that would be undesirable in a real-world use case. However, adversarial attacks can be unintelligible to humans, for example, by prefixing the string “aaabbbcc” to each prompt because it deteriorates model performance. Many examples of such attacks on various NLP classification and generation tasks is discussed  in [Wallace et al., ‘19](https://arxiv",
            ".acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) of generative models makes it hard to reproduce failure cases. Red-teaming gives actionable insights into model limitations and can be used to add guardrails and document model limitations. There are currently no red-teaming benchmarks or leaderboards highlighting the need for more work in open source red-teaming resources. [Anthropic's red-teaming dataset](https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf/tree/master/red-team-attempts) is the only open source resource of red-teaming prompts, but is limited to only English natural language text.",
            "**Red-teaming:** ['Red-teaming'](https://huggingface.co/blog/red-teaming) consists of stress testing AI models for potential vulnerabilities, biases, and weaknesses by prompting them and analyzing results. While it has been employed in practice for evaluating language models (including the upcoming [Generative AI Red Teaming event at DEFCON](https://aivillage.org/generative%20red%20team/generative-red-team/), which we are participating in), there are no established and systematic ways of red-teaming AI models and it remains relatively ad hoc. In fact, there are so many potential types of failure modes and biases in AI models, it is hard to anticipate them all, and the [stochastic nature](https://dl",

The pricing starts as low as $0.06 per CPU core/hr and $0.60 per GPU/hr, with custom pricing offered for the Enterprise plan, which includes dedicated support, 24/7 SLAs, and uptime guarantees. The actual cost is calculated by the minute, and additional charges may apply for data ingress/egress and ECR. To access Inference Endpoints, a valid payment method is required on the Hugging Face account. Pausing or scaling an endpoint to zero can significantly reduce costs when not in use. These details can be found on the Hugging Face pricing page and in the context provided.",

            "There are two pricing plans:\n\n- Inference Endpoints pricing is based on your hourly compute, and billed monthly. This can be as low as $0.06 per CPU core/hr and $0.6 per GPU/hr depending on your needs. \n- There is also an [Enterprise](https://huggingface.co/support) plan for Inference Endpoints which offers dedicated support, 24/7 SLAs, and uptime guarantees. Pricing for Enterprise is custom and based on volume commit and annual contracts; [contact us](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/enterprise) for a quote if you're interested!\n\nAfter you've added a valid payment method to your account, access the [Inference Endpoints web application](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) and start deploying! 🥳",
