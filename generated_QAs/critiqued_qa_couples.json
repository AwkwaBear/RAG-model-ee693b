The overestimation of Q values can occur in Q-learning due to the maximization step, where the algorithm selects the action with the highest Q value. This can lead to overoptimistic value estimates and suboptimal policies.\n\nDDQN addresses this issue by using two separate networks: the online network and the target network. The online network is used to select actions and estimate Q values, while the target network is used to estimate the target Q values. During the update step, the target Q values are computed using the online network to select actions, but the target network is used to estimate the Q values. This decouples the action selection and Q value estimation steps, reducing the likelihood of overestimation.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem because it explains how DDQN helps reduce the overestimation of Q values, which is a common issue in reinforcement learning. Understanding this concept can help developers build more accurate and efficient NLP models that use reinforcement learning techniques.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The question asks about the specific way in which Double DQN addresses the problem of overestimation of Q values, which is a common issue in reinforcement learning.

We will also talk about how to use `gradio` and [skops](https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to build interfaces with only one line of code!\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started).\n\n## Let's Create a Simple Interface!\n\nWe will take a look at how we can create a simple UI that predicts failures based on product information.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport pandas as pd\nimport joblib\nimport datasets\n\n\ninputs = [gr.Dataframe(row_count = (2, \"dynamic\"), col_count=(4,\"dynamic\"), label=\"Input Data\", interactive=1)]\n\noutputs = [gr.Dataframe(row_count = (2, \"dynamic\"), col_count=(1, \"fixed\"), label=\"Predictions\", headers=[\"Failures\"])]\n\nmodel = joblib.load(\"model.pkl\")\n\n# we will give our dataframe as example\ndf = datasets.load_dataset(\"merve/supersoaker-failures\")\ndf = df[\"train\"].to_pandas()\n\ndef infer(input_dataframe):\n  return pd.DataFrame(model.predict(input_dataframe))\n\ngr.Interface(fn = infer, inputs = inputs, outputs = outputs, examples = [[df.head(2)]]).launch()\n```\n\nAnswer::: \nEvaluation: The context does not provide a specific dataset name, but it does mention that the example uses a dataset called \"supersoaker-failures\" from the Hugging Face Datasets library. However, it is not clear whether this is the name of the dataset used in the example or just an example dataset used for illustration purposes. Therefore, I would rate this a 3, as the answer is somewhat ambiguous.\nTotal rating: 3",

However, it is a common practice to use the MNIST dataset in examples related to image classification. Therefore, it can be inferred that the MNIST dataset is used in the example.\n\nEvaluation: The question is context-independent as it asks for the name of the dataset used in the example. The name of the dataset is not explicitly stated in the question, but it can be inferred based on common practices in the field.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

The only argument you have to provide is a directory where the trained model will be saved, as well as the checkpoints along the way.

This is because BERT has not been pretrained on classifying pairs of sentences, so the head of the pretrained model has been discarded and a new head suitable for sequence classification has been added instead.

This is essential to specify the behavior of your chat assistant –and even imbue it with some personality–, but it's unreachable in models served behind APIs.\n\nWe're adding this section just a few days after the initial release of Llama 2, as we've had many questions from the community about how to prompt the models and how to change the system prompt. We hope this helps!\n\nThe prompt template for the first turn looks like this:\n\n```\n<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n{{ system_prompt }}\n<</SYS>>\n\n{{ user_message }} [/INST]\n```\n\nThis template follows the model's training procedure, as described in [the Llama 2 paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.09288). We can use any `system_prompt` we want, but it's crucial that the format matches the one used during training.\n\nTo spell it out in full clarity, this is what is actually sent to the language model when the user enters some text (`There's a llama in my garden 😱 What should I do?`) in [our 13B chat demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/llama-2-13b-chat) to initiate a chat:\n\n```b\n<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.  Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.

This is essential to specify the behavior of your chat assistant –and even imbue it with some personality–, but it's unreachable in models served behind APIs.\n\nWe're adding this section just a few days after the initial release of Llama 2, as we've had many questions from the community about how to prompt the models and how to change the system prompt. We hope this helps!\n\nThe prompt template for the first turn looks like this:\n\n```\n<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n{{ system_prompt }}\n<</SYS>>\n\n{{ user_message }} [/INST]\n```\n\nThis template follows the model's training procedure, as described in [the Llama 2 paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.09288). We can use any `system_prompt` we want, but it's crucial that the format matches the one used during training.\n\nTo spell it out in full clarity, this is what is actually sent to the language model when the user enters some text (`There's a llama in my garden 😱 What should I do?`) in [our 13B chat demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/llama-2-13b-chat) to initiate a chat:\n\n```b\n<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.  Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.\n\nAnswer::: \nThere's a llama in my garden 😱 What should I do?\n<</SYS>>\n```\n\nAnswer:::\nThe prompt template for the first turn in Llama 2 is as follows:\n\n[INST] <<SYS>>\n{{ system_prompt }}\n<</SYS>>\n\n{{ user_message }}\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous template for the first turn prompt in Llama 2, including the use of the '{{ system_prompt }}' and '{{ user_message }}' placeholders.\n\nTotal rating: 5\n```",

        "context": "The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\n*Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance.

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.\nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet.

The main difference between them is the way they process the input image. ViT treats the image as a sequence of patches and applies a Transformer architecture to it, while ConvNeXT applies a series of convolutional layers followed by a Transformer layer. This results in different performance characteristics and trade-offs between the two architectures.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood. It is clear what the two architectures being compared are, and what the main difference between them is.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L logL) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions.

Tokenization: BERT uses WordPiece tokenization, which breaks down words into subwords or individual characters.\n2. SentencePiece: BERT also uses SentencePiece, which is a subword tokenizer that can handle a variety of languages and character sets.\n3. Segmentation: BERT uses segmentation to differentiate between two sentences in a single input sequence. This is done by adding a special token ([SEP]) at the end of each sentence and a special token ([CLS]) at the beginning of the input sequence.\n4. Padding and Truncation: BERT pads shorter sequences with special tokens ([PAD]) to make them the same length as the longest sequence in a batch. It also truncates longer sequences to a maximum length.\n5. Conversion to IDs: BERT converts each token to an ID from the vocabulary file.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem, as it provides a clear understanding of the preprocessing steps used by BERT.

Tokenization: BERT uses WordPiece tokenization, which breaks down words into subwords or tokens that are present in its vocabulary.\n2. SentencePiece: BERT uses SentencePiece to handle sentence-level tokenization and to generate subwords.\n3. BPE: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is used to learn a vocabulary from a given corpus.\n4. Segmentation: BERT uses a special token ([CLS]) to represent the beginning of a sentence and another special token ([SEP]) to represent the end of a sentence.\n5. Attention Mask: BERT uses an attention mask to differentiate between actual input tokens and padding tokens.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood.

It explains that to define a Textbox outside of the Blocks() scope in Gradio, one should define the `gr.Textbox` outside of the `gr.Blocks()` scope and use the component's `.render()` method wherever it should be placed in the UI. The full code example further illustrates this solution.\nTotal rating: 5",

This allows for faster training times as the components can be processed simultaneously.

Each stage processes its input data and passes the output to the next stage in the pipeline. This allows for efficient utilization of multiple GPUs, as each GPU is responsible for a different stage of the pipeline, rather than having all GPUs work on the same stage. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies due to the need to transfer data between GPUs, as well as potential synchronization issues.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood.

This problem is known as the \"neighborhood explosion problem\" or \"over-smoothing problem\". The problem arises because as the number of layers in the GNN increases, the receptive field of each node also increases, causing the node representation to become increasingly similar to that of its neighbors. This can lead to a loss of important information and a decrease in the model's performance. The question is relevant to NLP developers using the Hugging Face ecosystem because GNNs are becoming increasingly popular in NLP applications, such as text classification and semantic role labeling.\nTotal rating: 4",

        "context": "#### Predicting the Language of a Dataset \n\nOnce we have some examples of text from a dataset, we need to predict the language. There are various options here, but for this work, we used the [facebook/fasttext-language-identification](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) fastText model created by [Meta](https://huggingface.co/facebook) as part of the [No Language Left Behind](https://ai.facebook.com/research/no-language-left-behind/) work. This model can detect 217 languages which will likely represent the majority of languages for datasets hosted on the Hub. \n\nWe pass 20 examples to the model representing rows from a dataset. This results in 20 individual language predictions (one per row) for each dataset.  \n\nOnce we have these predictions, we do some additional filtering to determine if we will accept the predictions as a metadata suggestion. This roughly consists of:\n\n- Grouping the predictions for each dataset by language: some datasets return predictions for multiple languages. We group these predictions by the language predicted i.e. if a dataset returns predictions for English and Dutch, we group the English and Dutch predictions together. \n- For datasets with multiple languages predicted, we count how many predictions we have for each language. If a language is predicted less than 20% of the time, we discard this prediction. i.e. if we have 18 predictions for English and only 2 for Dutch we discard the Dutch predictions. \n- We calculate the mean score for all predictions for a language. If the mean score associated with a languages prediction is below 80% we discard this prediction.\n\n <p align=\"center\"> \n     <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/huggy_lingo/prediction-flow.png\" alt=\"Prediction workflow\"><br> \n     <em>Diagram showing how predictions are handled.</em> \n </p>",

There are various options here, but for this work, we used the [facebook/fasttext-language-identification](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) fastText model created by [Meta](https://huggingface.co/facebook) as part of the [No Language Left Behind](https://ai.facebook.com/research/no-language-left-behind/) work. This model can detect 217 languages which will likely represent the majority of languages for datasets hosted on the Hub. \n\nWe pass 20 examples to the model representing rows from a dataset. This results in 20 individual language predictions (one per row) for each dataset.  \n\nOnce we have these predictions, we do some additional filtering to determine if we will accept the predictions as a metadata suggestion. This roughly consists of:\n\n- Grouping the predictions for each dataset by language: some datasets return predictions for multiple languages. We group these predictions by the language predicted i.e. if a dataset returns predictions for English and Dutch, we group the English and Dutch predictions together. \n- For datasets with multiple languages predicted, we count how many predictions we have for each language. If a language is predicted less than 20% of the time, we discard this prediction. i.e. if we have 18 predictions for English and only 2 for Dutch we discard the Dutch predictions. \n- We calculate the mean score for all predictions for a language.

Knowing the number of languages that fastText can detect can help developers determine if the model is suitable for their specific use case. Additionally, this information can be useful for developers who are comparing different NLP models and need to consider language support as a factor in their decision-making process.\nTotal rating: 4",

We can speed\nup the mapping by using multiple processes with `num_proc=4`.\n\n```python\nsample_size = 10000\ndata_stats = train_data.select(range(sample_size)).map(map_to_length, num_proc=4)\n```\n\nHaving computed the length for the first 10000 samples, we should now\naverage them together. For this, we can make use of the `.map()`\nfunction with `batched=True` and `batch_size=-1` to have access to all\n10000 samples within the `.map()` function.\n\n```python\ndef compute_and_print_stats(x):\n  if len(x[\"article_len\"]) == sample_size:\n    print(\n        \"Article Mean: {}, %-Articles > 512:{}, Summary Mean:{}, %-Summary > 64:{}, %-Summary > 128:{}\".format(\n            sum(x[\"article_len\"]) / sample_size,\n            sum(x[\"article_longer_512\"]) / sample_size, \n            sum(x[\"summary_len\"]) / sample_size,\n            sum(x[\"summary_longer_64\"]) / sample_size,\n            sum(x[\"summary_longer_128\"]) / sample_size,\n        )\n    )\n\noutput = data_stats.map(\n  compute_and_print_stats, \n  batched=True,\n  batch_size=-1,\n)\n```\n\n```python\n\tOUTPUT:\n\t-------\n    Article Mean: 847.6216, %-Articles > 512:0.7355, Summary Mean:57.7742, %-Summary > 64:0.3185, %-Summary > 128:0.0\n```\n\nWe can see that on average an article contains 848 tokens with *ca.* 3/4\nof the articles being longer than the model\\'s `max_length` 512. The\nsummary is on average 57 tokens long. Over 30% of our 10000-sample\nsummaries are longer than 64 tokens, but none are longer than 128\ntokens.\n\nAnswer::: \nEvaluation: The question asks for the average number of tokens in an article. The context provides the average number of tokens in the first 10000 samples of the dataset. However, it is not explicitly stated that these 10000 samples are representative of the entire dataset. Therefore, the answer may not be accurate for the entire dataset.\nTotal rating: 3",

Whole word masking is a technique used in language models to mask entire words instead of individual tokens, which can help the model better understand the context and meaning of words in a sentence. The probability of whole word masking refers to the likelihood that a given word will be selected for masking during the training or inference process. Understanding this concept is important for developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem, as it can impact the performance and accuracy of language models.\n\nTotal rating: 4",

The BiT architecture is based on the standard Transformer architecture, but with some modifications to make it more suitable for transfer learning tasks.\n\nThe BiT architecture consists of a stack of Transformer layers, each of which contains a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network. The input to the model is a sequence of tokens, which are first embedded using a token embedding layer. The token embeddings are then passed through the Transformer layers to produce the final output.\n\nOne key difference between BiT models and other Transformer-based models is that BiT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text using a self-supervised objective, such as masked language modeling or next sentence prediction. This pre-training allows BiT models to learn rich language representations that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks.\n\nAnother important aspect of the BiT architecture is the use of a large batch size during pre-training, which helps the model to learn more robust and generalizable representations. Additionally, BiT models use a technique called layer normalization, which helps to stabilize the training process and improve the model's performance.\n\nOverall, the BiT architecture is a powerful and flexible model architecture that has been shown to be effective for a wide range of NLP tasks.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers who are interested in building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem, as it provides an overview of the architecture of BiT models and how they are used for transfer learning. Understanding the BiT architecture can help developers to choose the right model for their NLP task and to fine-tune the model for optimal performance.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The main difference is that BiT models are trained on a much larger dataset, which allows them to achieve better performance on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, BiT models use a different tokenization scheme, which is optimized for computer vision tasks.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independant, since it refers to a specific technical term, BiT, which is a well-defined concept in the field of machine learning.

This improvement benefits from learning a large amount of monolingual and parallel corpora. Although it is generally acknowledged that parallel corpora are critical for improving the model performance, existing methods are often constrained by the size of parallel corpora, especially for lowresource languages. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-M, a new training method that encourages the model to align the representation of multiple languages with monolingual corpora, to overcome the constraint that the parallel corpus size places on the model performance. Our key insight is to integrate back-translation into the pre-training process. We generate pseudo-parallel sentence pairs on a monolingual corpus to enable the learning of semantic alignments between different languages, thereby enhancing the semantic modeling of cross-lingual models.

The pre-tokenization operation is the operation performed after the normalization of the text and before the application of the tokenization algorithm. This step consists in applying rules that do not need to be learned to perform a first division of the text. Let's look at how several tokenizers pre_tokenize this example. The gpt 2 pretokenization divides the text on spaces and some punctuation - but the apostrophe is not a division criterion for example. We also notice that spaces have been replaced by a capital G with a dot above. Albert's pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of spaces, adds a space at the beginning of the sentence and replaces spaces with a special underscore. Finally, Bert's pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of punctuation and spaces. Unlike the previous tokenizers, spaces are not transformed and integrated to the tokens produced with this pre-tokenizer. Through these 3 examples, we could observe the two main types of operations brought by the pre-tokenization: some changes on the text and the division of the string into tokens that can be associated to words. Finally, the \"backend_tokenizer\" of the fast tokenizers also allows to test the pre-tokenization operation very easily thanks to its \"pre_tokenize_str\" method. We notice that the output of this operation is composed of both tokens and offsets which allow to link the token to its position in the text given in input of the method.

This step can also involve some changes on the text such as replacing spaces with a special underscore or replacing spaces with a capital G with a dot above. The pre-tokenization operation is performed after the normalization of the text and before the application of the tokenization algorithm.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous answer to the question. It explains that the pre-tokenization step applies rules to divide the text into tokens that can be associated to words, and it also mentions that this step can involve some changes on the text. The context also explains that the pre-tokenization operation is performed after the normalization of the text and before the application of the tokenization algorithm.

This step helps to convert raw text into a format that can be processed by machine learning models. It is especially important in the Hugging Face ecosystem, where models often expect input in the form of subwords or tokens rather than full words. Therefore, understanding the main function of the pre-tokenization step is essential for developers building NLP applications with Hugging Face.\nTotal rating: 5",

Because sometimes they didn't even know what kind of things they wanted to save or wanted to really have a trace of. So we did a couple of them in some places like we would come back every couple of months and check in. And then a year later we had a couple, especially a food kitchen, we actually managed to make a connection between them, and I don't remember what the company name was anymore, but they essentially did this supply chain management software thing. And so the kitchen was actually able to implement a system where they would track like we got 10 pounds of tomatoes, this many people showed up today, and this is the waste of food we have.

Image-to-image generates a new image that resembles the existing provided image. Inpainting does the same thing, but it only transforms the image area defined by the mask and the rest of the image is unchanged. You can think of inpainting as a more precise tool for making specific changes and image-to-image has a broader scope for making more sweeping changes.\n\n## Control image generation\n\nGetting an image to look exactly the way you want is challenging because the denoising process is random. While you can control certain aspects of generation by configuring parameters like `negative_prompt`, there are better and more efficient methods for controlling image generation.\n\n### Prompt weighting",

Image-to-image generates a new image that resembles the existing provided image. Inpainting does the same thing, but it only transforms the image area defined by the mask and the rest of the image is unchanged. You can think of inpainting as a more precise tool for making specific changes and image-to-image has a broader scope for making more sweeping changes.\n\n## Control image generation\n\nGetting an image to look exactly the way you want is challenging because the denoising process is random. While you can control certain aspects of generation by configuring parameters like `negative_prompt`, there are better and more efficient methods for controlling image generation.\n\n### Prompt weighting\n\nAnswer::: \nPrompt weighting is a technique that allows you to control the importance of certain words or phrases in the prompt. By assigning a higher weight to specific words or phrases, you can guide the model to generate an image that emphasizes those aspects.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear explanation of prompt weighting and how it can be used to control image generation. It explains that prompt weighting allows you to assign a higher importance to certain words or phrases in the prompt, which in turn guides the model to generate an image that emphasizes those aspects.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

By adjusting the weights assigned to different parts of the prompt, users can guide the model to generate images that better match their desired outcome. For example, if a user wants to emphasize a particular object or feature in the image, they can increase the weight of the corresponding part of the prompt. Conversely, if they want to de-emphasize an object or feature, they can decrease its weight. In this way, prompt weighting provides a powerful tool for controlling the output of text-to-image generation models.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood. It is clear from the question that prompt weighting refers to a technique used in text-to-image generation models, and the question asks how this technique controls image generation. The answer explains the concept of prompt weighting and how it can be used to control the importance of the input prompt in generating the output image.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

So if they are set to 5e8, this requires a 9GB\n  footprint (`5e8 x 2Bytes x 2 x 4.5`). Therefore, if you have a GPU with 8GB or less RAM, to avoid getting\n  OOM-errors you will need to reduce those parameters to about `2e8`, which would require 3.6GB. You will want to do\n  the same on larger capacity GPU as well, if you're starting to hit OOM.\n- when reducing these buffers you're trading communication speed to avail more GPU RAM. The smaller the buffer size is,\n  the slower the communication gets, and the more GPU RAM will be available to other tasks. So if a bigger batch size is\n  important, getting a slightly slower training time could be a good trade.\n\nAdditionally, `deepspeed==0.4.4` added a new option `round_robin_gradients` which you can enable with:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"zero_optimization\": {\n        \"round_robin_gradients\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a stage 2 optimization for CPU offloading that parallelizes gradient copying to CPU memory among ranks by fine-grained gradient partitioning.

Therefore, if you have a GPU with 8GB or less RAM, to avoid getting\n  OOM-errors you will need to reduce those parameters to about `2e8`, which would require 3.6GB. You will want to do\n  the same on larger capacity GPU as well, if you're starting to hit OOM.\n- when reducing these buffers you're trading communication speed to avail more GPU RAM. The smaller the buffer size is,\n  the slower the communication gets, and the more GPU RAM will be available to other tasks. So if a bigger batch size is\n  important, getting a slightly slower training time could be a good trade.\n\nAdditionally, `deepspeed==0.4.4` added a new option `round_robin_gradients` which you can enable with:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"zero_optimization\": {\n        \"round_robin_gradients\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a stage 2 optimization for CPU offloading that parallelizes gradient copying to CPU memory among ranks by fine-grained gradient partitioning. Performance benefit grows with gradient accumulation steps (more copying between optimizer steps) or GPU count (increased parallelism).\n\n\n<a id='deepspeed-zero3-config'></a>\n\n#### ZeRO-3 Config\n\nAnswer::: \n\nEvaluation: The context provides a detailed explanation of the ZeRO-2 configuration and its performance tuning options. However, the context does not provide any information about the performance benefit of enabling `round_robin_gradients` in ZeRO stage 2. The context only mentions that this option is available in ZeRO stage 2, but it does not provide any details about its performance impact. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question unambiguously with the given context.\n\nTotal rating: 1",

It refers to a specific feature (`round_robin_gradients`) and a specific configuration (ZeRO stage 2), and it asks about the performance benefit of enabling that feature in that configuration. The terms `round_robin_gradients`, `ZeRO stage 2`, and `performance benefit` are all well-defined and unambiguous, and an operator with access to documentation would be able to understand what the question is asking.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

The `BaseExample` component has a `value` property, but the type of this property is not explicitly defined in the code. However, the `BaseDropdown` and `BaseMultiselect` components have a `value` property with a type of `string | number | (string | number)[] | undefined`. Since `BaseExample` is imported from the same module as `BaseDropdown` and `BaseMultiselect`, it is reasonable to assume that the `value` property in `BaseExample` has a similar type. Therefore, the type of the `value` property in the `BaseExample` component is likely to be `string | number | (string | number)[] | undefined`.\nTotal rating: 4",

You can mix and match models to create other diffusion systems.\n\nModels are initiated with the [`~ModelMixin.from_pretrained`] method which also locally caches the model weights so it is faster the next time you load the model. For the quicktour, you'll load the [`UNet2DModel`], a basic unconditional image generation model with a checkpoint trained on cat images:\n\n```py\n>>> from diffusers import UNet2DModel\n\n>>> repo_id = \"google/ddpm-cat-256\"\n>>> model = UNet2DModel.from_pretrained(repo_id, use_safetensors=True)\n```\n\nTo access the model parameters, call `model.config`:\n\n```py\n>>> model.config\n```\n\nThe model configuration is a 🧊 frozen 🧊 dictionary, which means those parameters can't be changed after the model is created. This is intentional and ensures that the parameters used to define the model architecture at the start remain the same, while other parameters can still be adjusted during inference.\n\nSome of the most important parameters are:\n\n* `sample_size`: the height and width dimension of the input sample.\n* `in_channels`: the number of input channels of the input sample.\n* `down_block_types` and `up_block_types`: the type of down- and upsampling blocks used to create the UNet architecture.\n* `block_out_channels`: the number of output channels of the downsampling blocks; also used in reverse order for the number of input channels of the upsampling blocks.\n* `layers_per_block`: the number of ResNet blocks present in each UNet block.\n\nAnswer::: \nThe context does not provide enough information to determine the specific method used by most models to predict the noise residual.\n\nEvaluation: The context describes what a noise residual is and that most models predict it, but it does not provide information on the specific method used to predict it.\n\nTotal rating: 2",

However, the term 'noise residual' is not commonly used in the context of machine learning or NLP. It is possible that the question is referring to the residual error, which is the difference between the actual and predicted values.\n\nIn general, there is no single method used by most models to predict the residual error. The method used depends on the specific model and the problem being solved. For example, linear regression models use the formula y = mx + b to predict the residual error, while neural networks use complex mathematical functions to estimate the residual error.\n\nEvaluation: The question is not very clear and uses a term that is not commonly used in the field of machine learning. Additionally, the question assumes that there is a single method used by most models to predict the residual error, which is not the case.\n\nTotal rating: 2",

If all predictions match their respective ground truth labels, the exact match score is 100%. Otherwise, it is less than 100%.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem because it helps them understand how to calculate the exact match score of their predictions, which is a common evaluation metric in NLP tasks.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The exact number of priors in the Jukebox model is not specified in the question, so it is not possible to provide a specific answer.\n\nEvaluation: The question refers to a specific deep learning model, the Jukebox model, but does not provide any context for where this model is being used or what it is being used for. The question also uses a technical term, \"priors,\" which is specific to deep learning models. However, the question is still relatively clear and understandable, as long as the reader has some familiarity with deep learning models and the concept of priors.\n\nTotal rating: 4"

The Mahalanobis distance is a measure of the distance between a point and a distribution. It is calculated as the square root of the dot product of the difference between the point and the mean of the distribution, and the inverse of the covariance matrix of the distribution. To compute the Mahalanobis distance, we need at least two lists: one for the point, and one for the distribution. Therefore, the minimum number of lists required to compute the Mahalanobis distance is 2.\nTotal rating: 3",

It is computed as the square root of the dot product of the difference between the point and the mean of the distribution, and the inverse of the covariance matrix of the distribution. Therefore, to compute the Mahalanobis distance, you need at least two things: the point and the distribution. The distribution is typically represented as a list of points, so you would need at least one list (containing the points of the distribution) to compute the Mahalanobis distance. However, you would also need the mean and covariance of the distribution, which can be computed from the list of points. Therefore, I would say that you need at least two lists to compute the Mahalanobis distance: one list containing the points of the distribution, and another list containing the point for which you want to compute the distance.\n\nEvaluation: This question is asking about a specific mathematical concept, the Mahalanobis distance, and how it is computed. The question is clear and concise, and does not rely on any specific context or additional information. The concept of the Mahalanobis distance is well-defined and widely used in machine learning and statistics, so it is likely that an operator with access to documentation would be familiar with it. The question asks for the minimum number of lists required to compute the Mahalanobis distance, which is a specific and well-defined question that does not depend on any additional context. Therefore, I would rate this question as a 5, since it is completely context-independent and easy to understand.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

Next, let's walk through the full procedure described in the paper.\n\n## How it works\n\n### 1. Structure from Motion\n\nThe first step is to use the Structure from Motion (SfM) method to estimate a point cloud from a set of images. This is a method for estimating a 3D point cloud from a set of 2D images. This can be done with the [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) library.\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/gaussian/points.png)\n\n### 2. Convert to Gaussians\n\nNext, each point is converted to a gaussian. This is already sufficient for rasterization. However, only position and color can be inferred from the SfM data. To learn a representation that yields high quality results, we need to train it.\n\n### 3. Training\n\nThe training procedure uses Stochastic Gradient Descent, similar to a neural network, but without the layers. The training steps are:\n\n1. Rasterize the gaussians to an image using differentiable gaussian rasterization (more on that later)\n2. Calculate the loss based on the difference between the rasterized image and ground truth image\n3. Adjust the gaussian parameters according to the loss\n4. Apply automated densification and pruning\n\nSteps 1-3 are conceptually pretty straightforward. Step 4 involves the following:\n\n- If the gradient is large for a given gaussian (i.e. it's too wrong), split/clone it\n  - If the gaussian is small, clone it\n  - If the gaussian is large, split it\n- If the alpha of a gaussian gets too low, remove it",

This distribution is used to model the density of points in a 3D space, and it is defined by its mean and covariance matrix. The mean determines the location of the distribution in the 3D space, while the covariance matrix determines the shape and orientation of the distribution.\n\nEvaluation: This question is asking about the first step in a specific procedure, the 3D Gaussian Splatting procedure.

It is set up by installing it via pip, and then importing it in a Python script. The specifics of the setup can vary depending on the use case, but generally involve specifying the model architecture, the training data, and the optimization parameters.\n\nEvaluation: This question is relatively context-independant, as it asks about the setup of a specific library, LoRA. However, it does not specify what kind of setup is being asked about (e.g. initial setup, training setup, deployment setup), so some additional context may be needed to provide a complete answer.\n\nTotal rating: 4"

This technique has been refined for Chinese in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08101).\n\nTo fine-tune a model using whole word masking, use the following script:\n```bash\npython run_mlm_wwm.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \\\n    --dataset_name wikitext \\\n    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \\\n    --do_train \\\n    --do_eval \\\n    --output_dir /tmp/test-mlm-wwm\n```\n\nFor Chinese models, we need to generate a reference files (which requires the ltp library), because it's tokenized at\nthe character level.\n\n**Q :** Why a reference file?\n\nAnswer::: \nThe reference file is needed for Chinese models because Chinese is tokenized at the character level, and the reference file is used to determine the correct word boundaries for whole word masking.\n\nEvaluation: The context explains that Chinese is tokenized at the character level, and that a reference file is needed for Chinese models to determine the correct word boundaries for whole word masking. The question asks why a reference file is needed, and the answer explains that it is needed to determine the correct word boundaries. Therefore, the answer is clearly and unambiguously answerable with the context.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

        "context": "Why is that? It has to do with the way GPUs work. They are extremely efficient at executing a lot of operations in parallel, but the drawback is that when one of those instructions results in an error, you don't know it instantly. It's only when the program calls a synchronization of the multiple processes on the GPU that it will realize something went wrong, so the error is actually raised at a place that has nothing to do with what created it. For instance, if we look at our previous traceback, the error was raised during the backward pass, but we will see in a minute that it actually stems from something in the forward pass.\n\nSo how do we debug those errors? The answer is easy: we don't. Unless your CUDA error is an out-of-memory error (which means there is not enough memory in your GPU), you should always go back to the CPU to debug it.\n\nTo do this in our case, we just have to put the model back on the CPU and call it on our batch -- the batch returned by the `DataLoader` has not been moved to the GPU yet:\n\n```python\noutputs = trainer.model.cpu()(**batch)\n```\n\n```python out\n~/.pyenv/versions/3.7.9/envs/base/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py in nll_loss(input, target, weight, size_average, ignore_index, reduce, reduction)\n   2386         )\n   2387     if dim == 2:\n-> 2388         ret = torch._C._nn.nll_loss(input, target, weight, _Reduction.get_enum(reduction), ignore_index)\n   2389     elif dim == 4:\n   2390         ret = torch._C._nn.nll_loss2d(input, target, weight, _Reduction.get_enum(reduction), ignore_index)\n\nIndexError: Target 2 is out of bounds.\n```\n\nSo, the picture is getting clearer. Instead of having a CUDA error, we now have an `IndexError` in the loss computation (so nothing to do with the backward pass, as we said earlier). More precisely, we can see that it's target 2 that creates the error, so this is a very good moment to check the number of labels of our model:\n\n```python\ntrainer.model.config.num_labels\n```",

The problem is that errors in GPU computations are not raised immediately, but only when the program calls a synchronization of the multiple processes on the GPU. The solution is to debug the errors on the CPU. The context does not contain any errors, but the code snippet provided at the end of the context does contain an error. The error is an `IndexError` in the loss computation, which is unrelated to the problem and solution described in the context.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The key insight of the MaskFormer model is its ability to perform semantic segmentation by predicting binary masks for each class, rather than predicting a class for each pixel. This approach simplifies the segmentation process and allows for more efficient training and inference. Additionally, the MaskFormer model introduces a new loss function called the \"Dice Loss\" which is specifically designed for binary mask prediction, further improving the model's performance.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

After that we continue with the normal training loop by for example calling backward. For the Trainer we can overwrite the compute loss function of the standard trainer.

This tensor has an additional dimension as the loss tensor we just saw because we get the information for each keyword in a separate matrix. Only want to know how many times keywords occurred per sample so we can sum over all keywords and all positions per sample. Now we are almost there, we only need to combine the loss with the weight per sample. We do this with element wise multiplication and then average over all samples in the batch.

We just need to make sure that that we return the loss and the model outputs in the same format. With that you can integrate your own awesome loss function with both the trainer and accelerates.\n\nAnswer::: \nEvaluation: The context provides a detailed explanation of how to create a custom weighted loss function, but it does not explicitly explain how to use this custom loss function with Accelerate or the Trainer. However, it does provide some clues. For example, it mentions that \"In Accelerate we just pass the input_ids to the models to get the logits and can then call the custom loss function.\" This suggests that the custom loss function can be called after getting the logits from the model in Accelerate. Similarly, for the Trainer, it mentions that \"we can overwrite the compute loss function of the standard trainer\" and that \"we just need to make sure that that we return the loss and the model outputs in the same format.\" This suggests that the custom loss function can be integrated with the Trainer by overwriting the compute loss function and ensuring that the output format is correct. Based on these clues, it is possible to infer how to use the custom loss function with Accelerate and the Trainer, but it is not explicitly stated.\nTotal rating: 3",

This technique works by learning and updating the text embeddings (the new embeddings are tied to a special word you must use in the prompt) to match the example images you provide.\n\nIf you're training on a GPU with limited vRAM, you should try enabling the `gradient_checkpointing` and `mixed_precision` parameters in the training command. You can also reduce your memory footprint by using memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](../optimization/xformers). JAX/Flax training is also supported for efficient training on TPUs and GPUs, but it doesn't support gradient checkpointing or xFormers. With the same configuration and setup as PyTorch, the Flax training script should be at least ~70% faster!\n\nThis guide will explore the [textual_inversion.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/textual_inversion/textual_inversion.py) script to help you become more familiar with it, and how you can adapt it for your own use-case.\n\nBefore running the script, make sure you install the library from source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\ncd diffusers\npip install .\n```",

With end-to-end deep learning systems, grouping of image regions usually happens implicitly via top-down supervision from pixel-level recognition labels. Instead, in this paper, we propose to bring back the grouping mechanism into deep networks, which allows semantic segments to emerge automatically with only text supervision. We propose a hierarchical Grouping Vision Transformer (GroupViT), which goes beyond the regular grid structure representation and learns to group image regions into progressively larger arbitrary-shaped segments. We train GroupViT jointly with a text encoder on a large-scale image-text dataset via contrastive losses. With only text supervision and without any pixel-level annotations, GroupViT learns to group together semantic regions and successfully transfers to the task of semantic segmentation in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without any further fine-tuning. It achieves a zero-shot accuracy of 52.3% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and 22.4% mIoU on PASCAL Context datasets, and performs competitively to state-of-the-art transfer-learning methods requiring greater levels of supervision.*\n\nThis model was contributed by [xvjiarui](https://huggingface.co/xvjiarui).

A full explanation of all the possible pitfalls is a bit beyond this example script and \nREADME, but for more information you can see the 'Input Datasets' section of \n[this document](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tpu).\n\n### Example command\n```\npython run_qa.py \\\n--model_name_or_path distilbert-base-cased \\\n--output_dir output \\\n--dataset_name squad \\\n--do_train \\\n--do_eval \\\n```",

        "context": "</Tip>\n\nIn this guide, we explore the solutions Transformers offer to deal with this issue. Note that this is an area of active development, so the APIs explained here may change slightly in the future.\n\n## Sharded checkpoints\n\nSince version 4.18.0, model checkpoints that end up taking more than 10GB of space are automatically sharded in smaller pieces. In terms of having one single checkpoint when you do `model.save_pretrained(save_dir)`, you will end up with several partial checkpoints (each of which being of size < 10GB) and an index that maps parameter names to the files they are stored in.\n\nYou can control the maximum size before sharding with the `max_shard_size` parameter, so for the sake of an example, we'll use a normal-size models with a small shard size: let's take a traditional BERT model.\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\n\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n```\n\nIf you save it using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], you will get a new folder with two files: the config of the model and its weights:\n\n```py\n>>> import os\n>>> import tempfile\n\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir)\n...     print(sorted(os.listdir(tmp_dir)))\n['config.json', 'pytorch_model.bin']\n```\n\nNow let's use a maximum shard size of 200MB:\n\n```py\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\"200MB\")\n...     print(sorted(os.listdir(tmp_dir)))\n['config.json', 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin', 'pytorch_model-00002-of-00003.bin', 'pytorch_model-00003-of-00003.bin', 'pytorch_model.bin.index.json']\n```\n\nOn top of the configuration of the model, we see three different weights files, and an `index.json` file which is our index. A checkpoint like this can be fully reloaded using the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method:",

The original code and weights can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md).\n\n## Usage tips\n\n- The checkpoints are named **mobilenet\\_v1\\_*depth*\\_*size***, for example **mobilenet\\_v1\\_1.0\\_224**, where **1.0** is the depth multiplier (sometimes also referred to as \"alpha\" or the width multiplier) and **224** is the resolution of the input images the model was trained on.\n\n- Even though the checkpoint is trained on images of specific size, the model will work on images of any size. The smallest supported image size is 32x32.\n\n- One can use [`MobileNetV1ImageProcessor`] to prepare images for the model.\n\n- The available image classification checkpoints are pre-trained on [ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k) (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million images and 1,000 classes). However, the model predicts 1001 classes: the 1000 classes from ImageNet plus an extra “background” class (index 0).\n\n- The original TensorFlow checkpoints use different padding rules than PyTorch, requiring the model to determine the padding amount at inference time, since this depends on the input image size. To use native PyTorch padding behavior, create a [`MobileNetV1Config`] with `tf_padding = False`.\n\nUnsupported features:\n\n- The [`MobileNetV1Model`] outputs a globally pooled version of the last hidden state. In the original model it is possible to use a 7x7 average pooling layer with stride 2 instead of global pooling. For larger inputs, this gives a pooled output that is larger than 1x1 pixel. The HuggingFace implementation does not support this.\n\n- It is currently not possible to specify an `output_stride`. For smaller output strides, the original model invokes dilated convolution to prevent the spatial resolution from being reduced further. The output stride of the HuggingFace model is always 32.",

They are then used as a starting point for use cases and applications through a process called **fine-tuning**. Fine-tuning involves applying additional training steps on the model on a different –often more specialized and smaller– dataset to optimize it for a specific application. Even though this step has a cost in terms of compute power needed, it is usually much less costly than training a model from scratch, both financially and environmentally. This is one reason high-quality open-source pretrained models are very interesting, as they can be freely used and built upon by the community even when the practitioners have only access to a limited computing budget. \n\n## 🗝️ 2022, from a race for size to a race for data\nWhat open models were available to the community before 2023?",

We describe the dataset creation process, present comprehensive filtering rules, and provide an analysis of the dataset's content. To show the viability of OBELISC, we train an 80 billion parameters vision and language model on the dataset and obtain competitive performance on various multimodal benchmarks.

However, to remain consistent with the model weights, you should use the `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype` and `torch_dtype` values.\n\n#### Nested quantization\n\nNested quantization is a technique that can save additional memory at no additional performance cost. This feature performs a second quantization of the already quantized weights to save an addition 0.4 bits/parameter. For example, with nested quantization, you can finetune a [Llama-13b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b) model on a 16GB NVIDIA T4 GPU with a sequence length of 1024, a batch size of 1, and enabling gradient accumulation with 4 steps.\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig\n\ndouble_quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    load_in_4bit=True,\n    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,\n)\n\nmodel_double_quant = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b\", quantization_config=double_quant_config)\n```\n\n## Optimum\n\nThe [Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index) library supports quantization for Intel, Furiosa, ONNX Runtime, GPTQ, and lower-level PyTorch quantization functions. Consider using Optimum for quantization if you're using specific and optimized hardware like Intel CPUs, Furiosa NPUs or a model accelerator like ONNX Runtime.\n\n## Benchmarks",
