It explains that Double DQN uses two networks to decouple the action selection from the target Q value generation. The DQN network is used to select the best action to take for the next state, and the Target network is used to calculate the target Q value of taking that action at the next state. This helps reduce the overestimation of Q values and improves the training speed and stability.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous answer to the question. It explains the concept of Double DQN and how it helps reduce the overestimation of Q values. The explanation is easy to understand and provides a clear understanding of the concept.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The overestimation of Q values can occur in Q-learning due to the maximization step, where the algorithm selects the action with the highest Q value. This can lead to overoptimistic value estimates and suboptimal policies.\n\nDDQN addresses this issue by using two separate networks: the online network and the target network. The online network is used to select actions and estimate Q values, while the target network is used to estimate the target Q values. During the update step, the target Q values are computed using the online network to select actions, but the target network is used to estimate the Q values. This decouples the action selection and Q value estimation steps, reducing the likelihood of overestimation.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem because it explains how DDQN helps reduce the overestimation of Q values, which is a common issue in reinforcement learning. Understanding this concept can help developers build more accurate and efficient NLP models that use reinforcement learning techniques.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

Now, the JSON data is passed and returned directly, making it easier to work with these components using the clients. \n\n### Migrating to Gradio 4.0\n\nHere are some concrete tips to help migrate to Gradio 4.0:\n\n#### **Using `allowed_paths`**\n\nSince the working directory is now not served by default, if you reference local files within your CSS or in a `gr.HTML` component using the `/file=` route, you will need to explicitly allow access to those files (or their parent directories) using the `allowed_paths` parameter in `launch()`\n\nFor example, if your code looks like this:\n\n```py\nimport gradio as gr\n\nAnswer::: \nThe `allowed_paths` parameter in `launch()` in Gradio 4.0 is used to explicitly allow access to local files that are referenced within your CSS or in a `gr.HTML` component using the `/file=` route.\n\nEvaluation: The context clearly explains the purpose of the `allowed_paths` parameter in `launch()` in Gradio 4.0, and provides an example of how to use it.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The `allowed_paths` parameter in the `launch()` function of Gradio 4.0 specifies the allowed paths for file uploads in the user interface. Understanding the purpose of this parameter can help developers to customize their user interfaces and restrict file uploads to specific directories, which can improve the security and usability of their applications.\n\nTotal rating: 4",

Check out our complete [audio classification guide](tasks/audio_classification) to learn how to finetune Wav2Vec2 and use it for inference!\n\n### Automatic speech recognition\n\nTo use the pretrained model for automatic speech recognition, add a language modeling head on top of the base Wav2Vec2 model for [connectionist temporal classification (CTC)](glossary#connectionist-temporal-classification-ctc). The language modeling head is a linear layer that accepts the encoder's hidden states and transforms them into logits. Each logit represents a token class (the number of tokens comes from the task vocabulary). The CTC loss is calculated between the logits and targets to find the most likely sequence of tokens, which are then decoded into a transcription.\n\nReady to try your hand at automatic speech recognition?

The main difference between them is the way they process the input image. ViT treats the image as a sequence of patches and applies a Transformer architecture to it, while ConvNeXT applies a series of convolutional layers followed by a Transformer layer. This results in different performance characteristics and trade-offs between the two architectures.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood. It is clear what the two architectures being compared are, and what the main difference between them is.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

        "context": "The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\n*Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L logL) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions.

Each component is responsible for a specific task, and the output of one component is used as the input for the next one. This allows for faster training times as the components can be processed simultaneously. However, this approach can lead to communication overhead between the GPUs, which can negatively impact performance.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem as it explains a fundamental concept in model parallelism, which is a crucial aspect of training large models.

Each stage processes its input data and passes the output to the next stage in the pipeline. This allows for efficient utilization of multiple GPUs, as each GPU is responsible for a different stage of the pipeline, rather than having all GPUs work on the same stage. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies due to the need to transfer data between GPUs, as well as potential synchronization issues.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood. It is clear from the question that the topic is about pipeline parallelism and the specific mechanism being referred to is naive pipeline parallelism. The question is asking for a definition or explanation of the concept, which is self-contained and does not rely on any external context.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

This results in 20 individual language predictions (one per row) for each dataset.  \n\nOnce we have these predictions, we do some additional filtering to determine if we will accept the predictions as a metadata suggestion. This roughly consists of:\n\n- Grouping the predictions for each dataset by language: some datasets return predictions for multiple languages. We group these predictions by the language predicted i.e. if a dataset returns predictions for English and Dutch, we group the English and Dutch predictions together. \n- For datasets with multiple languages predicted, we count how many predictions we have for each language. If a language is predicted less than 20% of the time, we discard this prediction. i.e. if we have 18 predictions for English and only 2 for Dutch we discard the Dutch predictions. \n- We calculate the mean score for all predictions for a language.

These parameters can accept a relative path which resolves to the base path corresponding to where the dataset is loaded from.\n\n```py\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n# load files that match the grep pattern\n>>> c4_subset = load_dataset(\"allenai/c4\", data_files=\"en/c4-train.0000*-of-01024.json.gz\")\n\n# load dataset from the en directory on the Hub\n>>> c4_subset = load_dataset(\"allenai/c4\", data_dir=\"en\")\n```\n\nThe `split` parameter can also map a data file to a specific split:\n\n```py\n>>> data_files = {\"validation\": \"en/c4-validation.*.json.gz\"}\n>>> c4_validation = load_dataset(\"allenai/c4\", data_files=data_files, split=\"validation\")\n```\n\n## Local loading script\n\nYou may have a 🤗 Datasets loading script locally on your computer. In this case, load the dataset by passing one of the following paths to [`load_dataset`]:\n\nAnswer::: \n\nTo load a dataset with a local loading script, you can pass the path to the local loading script to the `load_dataset` function.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous answer to the question.

As self-descriptive as it is, text-to-video is a fairly new computer vision task that involves generating a sequence of images from text descriptions that are both temporally and spatially consistent. While this task might seem extremely similar to text-to-image, it is notoriously more difficult. How do these models work, how do they differ from text-to-image models, and what kind of performance can we expect from them?\n\nIn this blog post, we will discuss the past, present, and future of text-to-video models. We will start by reviewing the differences between the text-to-video and text-to-image tasks, and discuss the unique challenges of unconditional and text-conditioned video generation.

As self-descriptive as it is, text-to-video is a fairly new computer vision task that involves generating a sequence of images from text descriptions that are both temporally and spatially consistent. While this task might seem extremely similar to text-to-image, it is notoriously more difficult. How do these models work, how do they differ from text-to-image models, and what kind of performance can we expect from them?\n\nIn this blog post, we will discuss the past, present, and future of text-to-video models. We will start by reviewing the differences between the text-to-video and text-to-image tasks, and discuss the unique challenges of unconditional and text-conditioned video generation. Additionally, we will cover the most recent developments in text-to-video models, exploring how these methods work and what they are capable of. Finally, we will talk about what we are working on at Hugging Face to facilitate the integration and use of these models and share some cool demos and resources both on and outside of the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/140_text-to-video/make-a-video.png\" alt=\"samples\"><br>\n    <em>Examples of videos generated from various text description inputs, image taken from <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792>Make-a-Video</a>.</em>\n</p>\n\nAnswer::: \nThe task of text-to-video models is to generate a sequence of images from text descriptions that are both temporally and spatially consistent.\n\nEvaluation: The context clearly defines the task of text-to-video models as generating a sequence of images from text descriptions that are both temporally and spatially consistent.

However, the `BaseDropdown` and `BaseMultiselect` components have a `value` property with a type of `string | number | (string | number)[] | undefined`. Since `BaseExample` is imported from the same module as `BaseDropdown` and `BaseMultiselect`, it is reasonable to assume that the `value` property in `BaseExample` has a similar type.

With Jukebox, there are several `lm_head` modules that should be skipped using the `llm_int8_skip_modules` parameter in [`BitsAndBytesConfig`]:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig\n\nmodel_id = \"bigscience/bloom-1b7\"\n\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    llm_int8_skip_modules=[\"lm_head\"],\n)\n\nmodel_8bit = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_id,\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n    quantization_config=quantization_config,\n)\n```\n\n#### Finetuning\n\nAnswer::: \nThe default threshold value for 8-bit quantization is 6.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous answer to the question. It states that \"A good default threshold value is 6\" in the context of 8-bit quantization.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

Next, let's walk through the full procedure described in the paper.\n\n## How it works\n\n### 1. Structure from Motion\n\nThe first step is to use the Structure from Motion (SfM) method to estimate a point cloud from a set of images. This is a method for estimating a 3D point cloud from a set of 2D images. This can be done with the [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) library.\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/gaussian/points.png)\n\n### 2.

To learn a representation that yields high quality results, we need to train it.\n\n### 3.

Calculate the loss based on the difference between the rasterized image and ground truth image\n3. Adjust the gaussian parameters according to the loss\n4. Apply automated densification and pruning\n\nSteps 1-3 are conceptually pretty straightforward. Step 4 involves the following:\n\n- If the gradient is large for a given gaussian (i.e. it's too wrong), split/clone it\n  - If the gaussian is small, clone it\n  - If the gaussian is large, split it\n- If the alpha of a gaussian gets too low, remove it",

This distribution is used to model the density of points in a 3D space, and it is defined by its mean and covariance matrix. The mean determines the location of the distribution in the 3D space, while the covariance matrix determines the shape and orientation of the distribution.\n\nEvaluation: This question is asking about the first step in a specific procedure, the 3D Gaussian Splatting procedure.

A common application is to aid visually impaired \npeople navigate through different situations, for instance, explore image content online. \n\nTo illustrate the task, get an image to be captioned, e.g.:\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n     <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/tasks/idefics-im-captioning.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a puppy in a flower bed\"/>\n</div>\n\nPhoto by [Hendo Wang](https://unsplash.com/@hendoo). \n\nIDEFICS accepts text and image prompts. However, to caption an image, you do not have to provide a text prompt to the \nmodel, only the preprocessed input image. Without a text prompt, the model will start generating text from the \nBOS (beginning-of-sequence) token thus creating a caption.\n\nAs image input to the model, you can use either an image object (`PIL.Image`) or a url from which the image can be retrieved.\n\n```py\n>>> prompt = [\n...     \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583160247711-2191776b4b91?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=3542&q=80\",\n... ]\n\n>>> inputs = processor(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n>>> bad_words_ids = processor.tokenizer([\"<image>\", \"<fake_token_around_image>\"], add_special_tokens=False).input_ids\n\n>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10, bad_words_ids=bad_words_ids)\n>>> generated_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n>>> print(generated_text[0])\nA puppy in a flower bed\n```\n\n<Tip>\n\nAnswer::: \nIDEFICS is a model that can be used for image captioning, which is the task of predicting a caption for a given image.\n\nEvaluation: The context clearly and unambiguously explains the task of image captioning and how IDEFICS can be used for this task.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

Please refer to [this guide](../guides/inference)\nfor more information on how to use it.\n\n## Inference Client\n\n[[autodoc]] InferenceClient\n\n## Async Inference Client\n\nAn async version of the client is also provided, based on `asyncio` and `aiohttp`.\nTo use it, you can either install `aiohttp` directly or use the `[inference]` extra:\n\n```sh\npip install --upgrade huggingface_hub[inference]\n# or\n# pip install aiohttp\n```\n\n[[autodoc]] AsyncInferenceClient\n\n## InferenceTimeoutError\n\n[[autodoc]] InferenceTimeoutError\n\n## Return types\n\nFor most tasks, the return value has a built-in type (string, list, image...). Here is a list for the more complex types.\n\n### ClassificationOutput\n\n[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.inference._types.ClassificationOutput\n\n### ConversationalOutputConversation\n\n[[autodoc]] huggingface_hub.inference._types.ConversationalOutputConversation\n\n### ConversationalOutput\n\nAnswer::: \nThe service that allows you to run accelerated inference on Hugging Face's infrastructure for free is the Inference API.\n\nEvaluation: The context clearly and unambiguously states that the Inference API is a service that allows you to run accelerated inference on Hugging Face's infrastructure for free.\n\nTotal rating: 5",
