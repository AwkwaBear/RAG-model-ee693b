It is the core machine learning model that performs the actual NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and language translation. The 'model' attribute is passed around quite a bit in the code, as it is used in various parts of the application, such as preprocessing the input data, running the model on the input data, and postprocessing the output data.

If you want to load adapter weights of another language \nmake sure to specify `target_lang=<your-chosen-target-lang>` as well as `\"ignore_mismatched_sizes=True`.\nThe `ignore_mismatched_sizes=True` keyword has to be passed to allow the language model head to be resized according\nto the vocabulary of the specified language.\nSimilarly, the processor should be loaded with the same target language\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, AutoProcessor\n\nmodel_id = \"facebook/mms-1b-all\"\ntarget_lang = \"fra\"\n\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, target_lang=target_lang)\nmodel = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(model_id, target_lang=target_lang, ignore_mismatched_sizes=True)\n```\n\n<Tip>\n\nYou can safely ignore a warning such as:\n\n```text\nSome weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/mms-1b-all and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:\n- lm_head.bias: found shape torch.Size([154]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([314]) in the model instantiated\n- lm_head.weight: found shape torch.Size([154, 1280]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([314, 1280]) in the model instantiated\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n```\n\n</Tip>\n\nAnswer::: \nEvaluation: The context provides a clear example of how to load a language adapter for a language other than English, and it mentions that the processor should be loaded with the same target language. However, it does not explicitly state how the processor should be loaded to use a language other than English, so the answer is not entirely unambiguous.\nTotal rating: 4",

For that you can just add `-m accelerate_tests` to your command, if let's say you want to run these tests on `OPT` run:\n\n```bash\nRUN_SLOW=1 pytest -m accelerate_tests tests/models/opt/test_modeling_opt.py \n```\n\n\n### Run documentation tests \n\nIn order to test whether the documentation examples are correct, you should check that the `doctests` are passing. \nAs an example, let's use [`WhisperModel.forward`'s docstring](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/whisper/modeling_whisper.py#L1017-L1035): \n\n```python \nr\"\"\"\nReturns:\n\nExample:\n    ```python\n    >>> import torch\n    >>> from transformers import WhisperModel, WhisperFeatureExtractor\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n    >>> model = WhisperModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-base\")\n    >>> feature_extractor = WhisperFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-base\")\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n    >>> inputs = feature_extractor(ds[0][\"audio\"][\"array\"], return_tensors=\"pt\")\n    >>> input_features = inputs.input_features\n    >>> decoder_input_ids = torch.tensor([[1, 1]]) * model.config.decoder_start_token_id\n    >>> last_hidden_state = model(input_features, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids).last_hidden_state\n    >>> list(last_hidden_state.shape)\n    [1, 2, 512]\n    ```\"\"\"\n\n```\n\nJust run the following line to automatically test every docstring example in the desired file: \n```bash \npytest --doctest-modules <path_to_file_or_dir>\n```\nIf the file has a markdown extention, you should add the `--doctest-glob=\"*.md\"` argument.\n\n### Run only modified tests\n\nAnswer::: \n\nTo run only modified tests in a file, you can use the `-m` flag with `pytest` and specify a pattern that matches the name of the modified tests.\n\nFor example, if you have modified tests named `test_modified_1` and `test_modified_2` in the `test_file.py` file, you can run these tests using the following command:\n\n```bash\npytest -m \"test_modified_1 or test_modified_2\" test_file.py\n```\n\nIf you want to run all modified tests in all files, you can use the `--markers-file` option to specify a file that contains a list of modified tests.\n\nFor example, you can create a file named `modified_tests.txt` with the following content:\n\n```\ntest_file1:test_modified_1\ntest_file1:test_modified_2\ntest_file2:test_modified_3\n```\n\nThen, you can run all modified tests using the following command:\n\n```bash\npytest --markers-file modified_tests.txt\n```\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a detailed explanation of how to run tests using `pytest` with various options and markers. It also explains how to run only tests that match a specific pattern using the `-m` flag. However, it does not explicitly mention how to run only modified tests. The answer provided here is based on the general knowledge of using `pytest` and the `-m` flag to specify a pattern that matches the name of the modified tests.\n\nTotal rating: 4\n\nConfidence: 90%",

This can be particularly important in large projects with many tests, where running all tests can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\nTotal rating: 4",

The STS-B task involves determining the similarity between two sentences on a scale of 0 to 5. The threshold for regression in this task would determine the point at which the model switches from predicting a similarity score to predicting a dissimilarity score.

They're used in both PyTorch and TensorFlow workflows, and maybe even in JAX, but no-one really knows what's happening in JAX. We have a research team working on that, so maybe they'll tell us soon. But what are data collators? Data collators collate data. More specifically, they put together a list of samples into a single training minibatch. For some tasks, the data collator can be very straightforward. For example, when you're doing sequence classification, all you really need from your data collator is that it pads your samples to the same length and concatenates them into a single Tensor. But for other workflows, data collators can be more complex, as they handle some of the preprocessing needed for that particular task. For PyTorch users, you usually pass the DataCollator to your Trainer object. In TensorFlow, the easiest way to use a DataCollator is to pass it to the to_tf_dataset method of your dataset. You'll see these approaches used in the examples and notebooks throughout this course. In both cases, you end up with an iterable that's going to output collated batches, ready for training. Note that all of our collators take a return_tensors argument - you can set this to \"pt\" to get PyTorch Tensors, \"tf\" to get TensorFlow Tensors, or \"np\" to get Numpy arrays. For backward compatibility reasons, the default value is \"pt\", so PyTorch users don't even have to set this argument most of the time, and so are often totally unaware that this option exists. This is a valuable lesson about how the beneficiaries of privilege are often the most blind to its existence.

The agent does not have any memory of the previous episodes, and the reward is reset to zero at the beginning of each episode.\n\nOn the other hand, in continuing tasks, the agent interacts with the environment in a continuous manner, without any terminal states. The agent has a memory of the previous states, and the reward is not reset to zero at any point.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood.

This is also called \"probabilistic forecasting\", as opposed to \"point forecasting\".

Additionally, classical methods are often point-valued, while deep learning methods can model a probabilistic distribution, enabling the modeling of uncertainties in predictions.\n\nEvaluation: The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the differences between classical and deep learning methods for time series forecasting.

These methods include ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and state-space models. They are often based on assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, such as stationarity and linearity. Deep learning methods, on the other hand, are machine learning methods that use artificial neural networks to learn patterns in data. These methods can model complex, non-linear relationships and do not rely on assumptions about the data. They can often achieve better forecasting accuracy than classical methods, especially for large and high-dimensional datasets.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independant, since it refers to general concepts that are well-known in the field of time series forecasting.

        "context": ". Perfect recall sounds great, but imagine if our generated summary had been “I really really really really loved reading the Hunger Games”. This would also have perfect recall, but is arguably a worse summary since it is verbose. To deal with these scenarios we can also compute precision, which in the ROUGE context measures how much of the generated summary was relevant. In this example, the precision is 6/7. In practice, both precision and recall are usually computed and then the F1-score is reported. We can change the granularity of the comparison by comparing bigrams instead of unigrams. With bigrams we chunk the sentence into pairs of consecutive words and then count how many pairs in the generated summary are present in the reference one. This gives us ROUGE-2 precision and recall, which we can see is lower than the ROUGE-1 scores we saw earlier. Note that if the summaries are long, the ROUGE-2 score will be small as there are typically fewer bigrams to match. This is also true for abstractive summarization, so both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores are usually reported. The last ROUGE variant we'll discuss is ROUGE-L. ROUGE-L doesn't compare n-grams, but instead treats each summary as a sequence of words and then looks for the longest common subsequence or LCS.

It measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the system summary and the reference summary, which can capture the semantic meaning of a sentence better than ROUGE-1 or ROUGE-2. ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 only consider unigram and bigram overlap, respectively, between the system summary and the reference summary, which may not accurately reflect the quality of the summary.

It is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm, which measures the longest contiguous sequence of words that are identical between the candidate and reference summaries. ROUGE-L is more advanced than ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 because it takes into account the order of the words in the sequence, while ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 only consider the presence or absence of individual words. This makes ROUGE-L a more robust and accurate metric for evaluating the quality of summaries.\n\nEvaluation: This question is about the ROUGE metric, which is a widely used metric for evaluating the quality of summaries. The question asks about the main advantage of ROUGE-L over ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, which are two other versions of the ROUGE metric.

If there is a software failure, always provide the full traceback, for example:\n\n   ```python\n   $ python -c 'import transformers'\n   Traceback (most recent call last):\n     File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n     File \"/transformers/src/transformers/__init__.py\", line 34, in <module>\n       from . import dependency_versions_check\n     File \"/transformers/src/transformers/dependency_versions_check.py\", line 34, in <module>\n       from .utils import is_tokenizers_available\n     File \"/transformers/src/transformers/utils/import_utils.py\", line 40, in <module>\n       from tqdm.auto import tqdm\n   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tqdm.auto'\n   ```\n\n   As compared to providing just the last line of the error message, e.g.:\n   ```python\n   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tqdm.auto'\n   ```\n   which is not sufficient.\n\n   If your application is running on more than one GPU (e.g. under `DistributedDataParallel`) and typically getting every log and traceback printed multiple times, please make sure that you paste only one copy of it. At times the traceback from parallel processes may get interleaved - so either disentangle these or change the loggers to log only for `local_rank==0` so that only one process logs things.\n\n4. When quoting a traceback, command line instructions and any type of code always enclose it in triple backticks inside the editor window, that is:\n\n   ````\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\n   cd transformers\n   pip install .\n   ```\n   ````\n\n   If it's a command line with a long argument list, please consider breaking it down using backslashes and new lines. Here is an example of a good command line quote:\n\nAnswer::: \nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous answer to the question. It explains that a full traceback should be provided in case of a software failure, and provides an example of what a full traceback looks like. It also explains that only one copy of the traceback should be provided if the application is running on multiple GPUs, and provides instructions on how to quote a traceback.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

This can typically be done by copying and pasting the output from the console or terminal where the software was running.\nIt is also helpful to include any additional context about the error, such as the steps that led up to the failure, the expected behavior, and any relevant configuration or environment details.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independant, as it is clear what a traceback is and how it should be provided in case of a software failure. The question does not rely on any specific context or setting, and the answer can be applied generally to any software failure scenario.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

By turning your Gradio app into a Discord bot, you can bring cutting edge AI to your discord server and give your community a whole new way to interact.\n\n## 💻 How does it work? 💻\n\nWith `gradio_client` version `0.3.0`, any gradio `ChatInterface` app on the internet can automatically be deployed as a discord bot via the `deploy_discord` method of the `Client` class.\n\nTechnically, any gradio app that exposes an api route that takes in a single string and outputs a single string can be deployed to discord. In this guide, we will focus on `gr.ChatInterface` as those apps naturally lend themselves to discord's chat functionality.\n\n## 🛠️ Requirements 🛠️\n\nMake sure you have the latest `gradio_client` and `gradio` versions installed.\n\n```bash\npip install gradio_client>=0.3.0 gradio>=3.38.0\n```\n\nAlso, make sure you have a [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/) and a [write access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).\n\n⚠️ Tip ⚠️: Make sure you login to the Hugging Face Hub by running `huggingface-cli login`.

If you're interested in this type of *generative* question answering, we recommend checking out our [demo](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html) based on the [ELI5 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5).\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Preparing the data[[preparing-the-data]]\n\nAnswer::: \nThe context states that Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries - Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n\nEvaluation: The context clearly and unambiguously answers the question, providing the names of the three deep learning libraries that back Transformers.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The special tokens get a label of -100, which is how we tell the Transformer loss functions to ignore them when computing the loss. The code is then pretty straightforward, we write a function that shifts the labels for tokens that are inside a word (that you can customize) and use it when generating the labels for each token. Once that function to create our labels is written, we can preprocess the whole dataset using the map function. With the option batched=True, we unleash the speed of out fast tokenizers. The last problem comes when we need to create a batch. Unless you changed the preprocessing function to apply some fixed padding, we will get sentences of various lengths, which we need to pad to the same length. The padding needs to be applied to the inputs as well as the labels, since we should have one label per token. Again, -100 indicates the labels that should be ignored for the loss computation. This is all done for us by the DataCollatorForTokenClassification, which you can use in PyTorch or TensorFlow.

As we've seen before, the AutoModel class allows you to instantiate a pretrained model from any checkpoint on the Hugging Face Hub.

As we can see, when given a BERT checkpoint, we end up with a BertModel, and similarly for GPT-2 or BART. Behind the scenes, this API can take the name of a checkpoint on the Hub, in which case it will download and cache the configuration file as well as the model weights file. You can also specify the path to a local folder that contains a valid configuration file and a model weights file. To instantiate the pretrained model, the AutoModel API will first open the configuration file to look at the configuration class that should be used. The configuration class depends on the type of the model (BERT, GPT-2 or BART for instance). Once it has the proper configuration class, it can instantiate that configuration, which is a blueprint to know how to create the model. It also uses this configuration class to find the proper model class, which is combined with the loaded configuration, to load the model. This model is not yet our pretrained model as it has just been initialized with random weights. The last step is to load the weights from the model file inside this model. To easily load the configuration of a model from any checkpoint or a folder containing the configuration folder, we can use the AutoConfig class.

Such representations could then be used for many downstream applications such as clustering, text mining, or question answering.\n\nWe developed state-of-the-art sentence embedding models as part of the project [\"Train the Best Sentence Embedding Model Ever with 1B Training Pairs\"](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/train-the-best-sentence-embedding-model-ever-with-1b-training-pairs/7354). This project took place during the [Community week using JAX/Flax for NLP & CV](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/open-to-the-community-community-week-using-jax-flax-for-nlp-cv/7104), organized by Hugging Face.  We benefited from efficient hardware infrastructure to run the project: 7 TPUs v3-8, as well as guidance from Google’s Flax, JAX, and Cloud team members about efficient deep learning frameworks!\n\n## Training methodology\n\n### Model\n\nUnlike words, we can not define a finite set of sentences. Sentence embedding methods, therefore, compose inner words to compute the final representation. For example, SentenceBert model ([Reimers and Gurevych, 2019](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1410.pdf)) uses Transformer, the cornerstone of many NLP applications, followed by a pooling operation over the contextualized word vectors.

When the error you get doesn't immediately suggest where the problem is, the best solution is often to walk through things in sequence, making sure at each stage that things look right. And of course, the place to start is always to check your data. The best way to do that to grab a batch from the tf.data.Dataset that your model is training on, right at the end of the training pipeline. And we can do that like so, by looping over the dataset for one iteration and then breaking\n\nAnswer::: \nThe best way to check the data when debugging a machine learning model is to grab a batch from the tf.data.Dataset that your model is training on, right at the end of the training pipeline.

This problem is known as the \"neighborhood explosion problem\" or \"over-smoothing problem\". The problem arises because as the number of layers in the GNN increases, the receptive field of each node also increases, causing the node representation to become increasingly similar to that of its neighbors. This can lead to a loss of important information and a decrease in the model's performance.

They are typically described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which specify the infinitesimal changes in the system over time.\n\nDiscrete diffusion models, on the other hand, are often used in computer science and statistics to model phenomena that evolve in discrete steps, such as the spread of information in a social network. They are typically described by difference equations, which specify the changes in the system from one time step to the next.\n\nIn the context of machine learning, continuous diffusion models have been used to develop generative models for continuous data, such as images and audio.

So [`IterableDataset.shuffle`] also shuffles the dataset shards if your dataset is made of multiple files or sources:\n\n```python\n# Stream from the internet\nmy_iterable_dataset = load_dataset(\"deepmind/code_contests\", split=\"train\", streaming=True)\nmy_iterable_dataset.n_shards  # 39\n\n# Stream from local files\ndata_files = {\"train\": [f\"path/to/data_{i}.csv\" for i in range(1024)]}\nmy_iterable_dataset = load_dataset(\"csv\", data_files=data_files, split=\"train\", streaming=True)\nmy_iterable_dataset.n_shards  # 1024",

And congrats on finishing the tutorial. You’ve just trained your first Deep Q-Learning agent and shared it on the Hub 🥳.\n\nAnswer::: \nThe context provides a clear explanation of how Double DQN helps reduce the overestimation of Q values. It explains that Double DQN uses two networks to decouple the action selection from the target Q value generation. The DQN network is used to select the best action to take for the next state, and the Target network is used to calculate the target Q value of taking that action at the next state. This helps reduce the overestimation of Q values and improves the training speed and stability.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear and unambiguous answer to the question. It explains the concept of Double DQN and how it helps reduce the overestimation of Q values. The explanation is easy to understand and provides a clear understanding of the concept.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The overestimation of Q values can occur in Q-learning because the maximum Q value is selected from the same set of Q values that are being updated. This can lead to an overestimation of the true Q value, which can negatively impact the performance of the learning algorithm.\n\nDouble DQN addresses this issue by using two separate Q-functions: one for selecting actions and one for evaluating the selected actions. During the update step, the action that maximizes the Q value is selected using the first Q-function, and the Q value for this action is then updated using the second Q-function. This helps to decouple the selection and evaluation of actions, which can reduce the overestimation of Q values and improve the stability and performance of the learning algorithm.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers who are building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem and are interested in using reinforcement learning techniques. Understanding how Double DQN helps to reduce the overestimation of Q values is important for implementing and using this method effectively.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The question asks about the specific way in which Double DQN addresses the problem of overestimation of Q values, which is a common issue in reinforcement learning. The question is clear and concise, and it does not depend on any specific context or additional information.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

Red-teaming shares some similarities and differences with the more well-known form of evaluation in ML called *adversarial attacks*. The similarity is that both red-teaming and adversarial attacks share the same goal of “attacking” or “fooling” the model to generate content that would be undesirable in a real-world use case. However, adversarial attacks can be unintelligible to humans, for example, by prefixing the string “aaabbbcc” to each prompt because it deteriorates model performance. Many examples of such attacks on various NLP classification and generation tasks is discussed  in [Wallace et al., ‘19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125). Red-teaming prompts, on the other hand, look like regular, natural language prompts.\n\nRed-teaming can reveal model limitations that can cause upsetting user experiences or enable harm by aiding violence or other unlawful activity for a user with malicious intentions. The outputs from red-teaming (just like adversarial attacks) are generally used to train the model to be less likely to cause harm or steer it away from undesirable outputs.\n\nAnswer::: \nThe goal of red-teaming language models is to craft a prompt that would trigger the model to generate text that is likely to cause harm.\n\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear definition of red-teaming language models and its goal. It also explains how red-teaming differs from adversarial attacks. The context also provides examples of real-world consequences of not thoroughly evaluating language models.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

This is an important step in the development of language models, as it helps to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and biases, and to ensure that the models can be used safely and effectively in a wide range of applications.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

It is asking about the concept of red-teaming, which is a well-known practice in the field of cybersecurity, and how it applies to language models. The question does not make any implicit references to a particular setting or context, and it is clear what is being asked.\n\nTotal rating: 5"

In the context of vision-language models, contrastive learning can be used to learn joint embeddings of image and text data, where similar pairs of image and text are attracted to each other in the embedding space, and dissimilar pairs are repelled. This can help the model to better understand the relationship between images and their corresponding textual descriptions, and improve its performance on downstream tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval.\n\nEvaluation: This question is useful for machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem because it helps to understand the objective of contrastive learning in vision-language models, which is a key technique used in many state-of-the-art models. By learning how contrastive learning works and how it can be applied to vision-language models, developers can improve their models' performance on downstream tasks and build more accurate and useful applications.\n\nTotal rating: 5",

The objective is to bring the representations of the image and text closer together in the embedding space if they are paired together, and push them apart if they are not paired together. This helps the model to learn meaningful relationships between the image and text, and improve its performance on downstream tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation.\n\nEvaluation: This question is context-independent and does not require any additional information to be understood. It is clear from the question that the objective of contrastive learning in vision-language models is being asked about. The concept of contrastive learning is a well-established technique in machine learning and is commonly used in vision-language models. Therefore, the question can be answered without any additional context.\n\nTotal rating: 5"
