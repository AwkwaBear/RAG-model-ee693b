This leads to more accurate and visually appealing outputs and opens new possibilities for text-guided image manipulation.*\n\nThe original codebase can be found at [ai-forever/Kandinsky-2](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2).\n\n<Tip>", "generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=10)\ngenerated_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0].strip()\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\n```\nTo light a fire.\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBLIP-2 is a zero-shot visual-language model that can be used for multiple image-to-text tasks with image and image and \ntext prompts. It is an effective and efficient approach that can be applied to image understanding in numerous scenarios, \nespecially when examples are scarce. \n\n\nThe model bridges the gap between vision and natural language modalities by adding a transformer between pre-trained models. \nThe new pre-training paradigm allows this model to keep up with the advances in both individual modalities."], "test_settings": "chunk:200_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_rerank:False_reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta", "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response correctly identifies the two-stage model's purpose as improving the text-to-image model by applying two training stages.

This aligns well with the reference answer, which states that the model generates a CLIP image embedding from a text caption and then generates an image conditioned on this embedding.

It presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\nspeed of BERT:\n\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices.\n- Using repeating layers split among groups.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:Document 1:::\nHowever, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengthsDocument 2:::\nIf you're training on a GPU with limited vRAM, try enabling `gradient_checkpointing`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, and `mixed_precision` to reduce memory-usage and speedup training.

This is generally achieved by utilizing the GPU \nas much as possible and thus filling GPU memory to its limit. If the desired batch size exceeds the limits of the GPU memory, \nthe memory optimization techniques, such as gradient accumulation, can help.\n\nHowever, if the preferred batch size fits into memory, there's no reason to apply memory-optimizing techniques because they can \nslow down the training. Just because one can use a large batch size, does not necessarily mean they should.

By reducing the memory requirements, ALBERT makes it possible to train the model on machines with limited resources, such as GPUs with limited vRAM.

While using a large batch size can improve throughput, it may not always result in the best performance.

[ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths", "If you're training on a GPU with limited vRAM, try enabling `gradient_checkpointing`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, and `mixed_precision` to reduce memory-usage and speedup training.

If the desired batch size exceeds the limits of the GPU memory, \nthe memory optimization techniques, such as gradient accumulation, can help.\n\nHowever, if the preferred batch size fits into memory, there's no reason to apply memory-optimizing techniques because they can \nslow down the training.

It was published by Timo L\u00fcddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn\u2019t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP.Document 2:::\n## CLIPSegVisionModel\n\n[[autodoc]] CLIPSegVisionModel\n    - forward\n\n## CLIPSegForImageSegmentation\n\n[[autodoc]] CLIPSegForImageSegmentation\n    - forwardDocument 3:::\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/clipseg_architecture.png\"\nalt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/> \n\n<small> CLIPSeg overview.

If more precise segmentations are required, it is recommended to fine-tune a state-of-the-art segmentation model, such as SegFormer, using labeled data from modern cameras, and then use CLIPSeg to generate rough labels as a starting point for refinement in a labeling tool like Segments.ai. This two-step approach can help improve the segmentation accuracy for modern camera images.", "retrieved_docs": ["Currently, CLIPSeg still has its limitations. For example, the model uses images of 352 x 352 pixels, so the output is quite low-resolution. This means we cannot expect pixel-perfect results when we work with images from modern cameras. If we want more precise segmentations, we can fine-tune a state-of-the-art segmentation model, as shown in [our previous blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-segformer). In that case, we can still use CLIPSeg to generate some rough labels, and then refine them in a labeling tool such as [Segments.ai](https://segments.ai/?utm_source=hf&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=clipseg). Before we describe how to do that, let\u2019s first take a look at how CLIPSeg works.", "## CLIPSeg: image segmentation with CLIP\n\n[CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) is a model that uses CLIP representations to create image segmentation masks. It was published by Timo L\u00fcddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn\u2019t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP.", "## CLIPSegVisionModel\n\n[[autodoc]] CLIPSegVisionModel\n    - forward\n\n## CLIPSegForImageSegmentation\n\n[[autodoc]] CLIPSegForImageSegmentation\n    - forward", "<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/clipseg_architecture.png\"\nalt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/> \n\n<small> CLIPSeg overview.

The model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT\nmodel with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform. The model is significantly faster\nthan the BERT model because it has fewer parameters and is more memory efficient. The model achieves about 92-97%\naccuracy of BERT counterparts on GLUE benchmark, and trains much faster than the BERT model. The abstract from the\npaper is the following:Document 1:::\n2.  Second, BERT\\'s *bi-directional* self-attention layers have to be\n    changed to *uni-directional* self-attention layers to comply with\n    auto-regressive generation. Because both the bi-directional and the\n    uni-directional self-attention layer are based on the same *key*,\n    *query* and *value* projection weights, the decoder\\'s\n    self-attention layer weights can be initialized with BERT\\'s\n    self-attention layer weights. *E.g.* the query, key and value weight\n    parameters of the decoder\\'s uni-directional self-attention layer\n    are initialized with those of BERT\\'s bi-directional self-attentionDocument 2:::\nAs an example, two years ago, one might have defined BERT's self attention layer as the standard attention layer used by all Transformers models. Logically, a \"standard\" attention function could have been moved into a central `attention.py` file. But then came attention layers that added relative positional embeddings in each attention layer (T5), multiple different forms of chunked attention (Reformer, Longformer, BigBird), and separate attention mechanism for position and word embeddings (DeBERTa), etc... Every time we would have to have asked ourselves whether the \"standard\" attention function should be adapted or whether it would have been better to add a new attention function to `attention.py`. But then how do we name it? `attention_with_positional_embd`, `reformer_attention`, `deberta_attention`?Document 3:::\nNext, a (repeatable) block of self-attention layers is applied to update the representations of the latents. Note that these don't depend on the length of the inputs (i.e. the bytes) one provided, as these were only used during the cross-attention operation. In the Perceiver IO paper, a single block of 26 self-attention layers (each of which has 8 attention heads) were used to update the representations of the latents of the text model. Note that the output after these 26 self-attention layers still has the same shape as what one initially provided as input to the encoder: (batch_size, 256, 1280). These are also called the \"last hidden states\" of the latents. This is very similar to the \"last hidden states\" of the tokens one provides to BERT.Document 4:::\nlayer \\\\(\\theta_{\\text{BERT}}^{\\text{self-attn}, 2} = \\{\\mathbf{W}_{\\text{BERT}, k}^{\\text{self-attn}, 2}, \\mathbf{W}_{\\text{BERT}, v}^{\\text{self-attn}, 2}, \\mathbf{W}_{\\text{BERT}, q}^{\\text{self-attn}, 2} \\}Document 5:::\nEach BERT block makes use of **bi-directional** self-attention to\nprocess an input sequence \\\\(\\mathbf{x'}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x'}_n\\\\) (shown\nin light grey) to a more \\\"refined\\\" contextualized output sequence\n\\\\(\\mathbf{x''}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x''}_n\\\\) (shown in slightly darker grey)\n\\\\({}^4\\\\).

The model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT\nmodel with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform. The model is significantly faster\nthan the BERT model because it has fewer parameters and is more memory efficient. The model achieves about 92-97%\naccuracy of BERT counterparts on GLUE benchmark, and trains much faster than the BERT model. The abstract from the\npaper is the following:", "2.  Second, BERT\\'s *bi-directional* self-attention layers have to be\n    changed to *uni-directional* self-attention layers to comply with\n    auto-regressive generation. Because both the bi-directional and the\n    uni-directional self-attention layer are based on the same *key*,\n    *query* and *value* projection weights, the decoder\\'s\n    self-attention layer weights can be initialized with BERT\\'s\n    self-attention layer weights. *E.g.* the query, key and value weight\n    parameters of the decoder\\'s uni-directional self-attention layer\n    are initialized with those of BERT\\'s bi-directional self-attention", "As an example, two years ago, one might have defined BERT's self attention layer as the standard attention layer used by all Transformers models. Logically, a \"standard\" attention function could have been moved into a central `attention.py` file. But then came attention layers that added relative positional embeddings in each attention layer (T5), multiple different forms of chunked attention (Reformer, Longformer, BigBird), and separate attention mechanism for position and word embeddings (DeBERTa), etc... Every time we would have to have asked ourselves whether the \"standard\" attention function should be adapted or whether it would have been better to add a new attention function to `attention.py`. But then how do we name it? `attention_with_positional_embd`, `reformer_attention`, `deberta_attention`?", "Next, a (repeatable) block of self-attention layers is applied to update the representations of the latents. Note that these don't depend on the length of the inputs (i.e. the bytes) one provided, as these were only used during the cross-attention operation. In the Perceiver IO paper, a single block of 26 self-attention layers (each of which has 8 attention heads) were used to update the representations of the latents of the text model. Note that the output after these 26 self-attention layers still has the same shape as what one initially provided as input to the encoder: (batch_size, 256, 1280).

Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the thousands of machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models, datasets and demos with the community. The `huggingface_hub` library provides a simple way to do all these things with Python.\n\n## Key featuresDocument 1:::\n## Support for third-party libraries\n\nCentral to the Hugging Face ecosystem is the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub), which lets people collaborate effectively on Machine Learning. As mentioned earlier, we not only support models from \ud83e\udd17 Transformers on the Hub but also models from other third-party libraries. To this end, we provide [several utilities](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries) so that you can integrate your own library with the Hub. One of the primary advantages of doing this is that it becomes very easy to share artifacts (such as models and datasets) with the community, thereby making it easier for your users to try out your models.Document 2:::\nHugging Face is now the fastest growing community & most used platform for machine learning!

Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control).\n\nThis guide covers auto reloading, reloading in a Python IDE, and using gradio with Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n## Why Auto-Reloading?\n\nWhen you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes.\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: How do you run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nTo run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new file for your app and name it `run.py`.\n2. Inside the file, import Gradio and create a Blocks object as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    # Add your UI components here\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\n3. Save the file and open it in your preferred Python IDE (such as PyCharm, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n4. Instead of running the script with `python run.py`, run it with `gradio run.py` to launch the app in reload mode.\n5. Gradio will now automatically reload the app whenever you make changes to the `run.py` file.\n\nNote: This feature is available for Gradio Blocks apps created using Python IDEs. If you're using Jupyter Notebooks, you can use the `%gradio` magic command to run your app in reload mode (more on this in the next section).\n\nDocumentation:\n- [Hot Reloading Guide](https://www.gradio.app/guides/developing-faster-with-reload-mode)\n- [Python IDE Reload \ud83d\udd25](https://docs.gradio.app/en/latest/guides/python-ide-reload/)\n- [Using Gradio with Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.gradio.app/en/latest/guides/jupyter-notebooks/)", "retrieved_docs": ["## Python IDE Reload \ud83d\udd25\n\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let's name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\n               inputs=inp,\n               outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```", "## \ud83d\ude80 Run a Gradio app\n\nYou can get started by creating an `app.py` file in the root:\n\n```\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n   gr.Button()\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n   demo.launch()\n```\n\nthen run:\n\n```\ngradio app.py\n```\n\nThis will start the backend server in reload mode, which will watch for changes in the `gradio` folder and reload the app if changes are made.
