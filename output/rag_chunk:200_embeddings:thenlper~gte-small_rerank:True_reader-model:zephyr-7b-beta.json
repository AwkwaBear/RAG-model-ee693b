Gradio demos are very easy to build, but what if you want more control over the layout of your demo, or more flexibility on how the data flows?  For example, you might want to:\n\n* Change the layout of your demo instead of just having all of the inputs on the left and outputs on the right\n* Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general\n* Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a Dropdown) or its visibilty based on user input\n\nThe low-level Blocks API allows you to do all of this, right in Python.\n\nHere's an example of a Blocks demo that creates two simple demos and uses tabs to group them together:Document 5:::\nGradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a **Flag** button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running.

Gradio demos are very easy to build, but what if you want more control over the layout of your demo, or more flexibility on how the data flows?  For example, you might want to:\n\n* Change the layout of your demo instead of just having all of the inputs on the left and outputs on the right\n* Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general\n* Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a Dropdown) or its visibilty based on user input\n\nThe low-level Blocks API allows you to do all of this, right in Python.\n\nHere's an example of a Blocks demo that creates two simple demos and uses tabs to group them together:", "Gradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a **Flag** button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running. In this Guide, we discuss more about how to use the flagging feature, both with `gradio.Interface` as well as with `gradio.Blocks`.\n\n## The **Flag** button in `gradio.Interface`", "You can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`.

The token classification head is a linear layer that accepts the final hidden states and performs a linear transformation to convert them into logits. The cross-entropy loss is calculated between the logits and each token to find the most likely label.\n\nReady to try your hand at token classification?

It was published by Timo L\u00fcddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn\u2019t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP.Document 2:::\n-->\n\n# CLIPSeg\n\n## Overview\n\nThe CLIPSeg model was proposed in [Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) by Timo L\u00fcddecke\nand Alexander Ecker. CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen [CLIP](clip) model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:Document 3:::\nThe reason why CLIP works so well is that the model was trained on a huge dataset of images with text captions.

This format, introduced by Hugging Face's `safetensors`, is a safe and fast alternative to Python's `pickle` utility, which is not secure and may contain malicious code. `.safetensors` is recommended for sharing model weights as it provides a secure alternative to `pickle`. To convert existing PyTorch model weights to `.safetensors`, the easiest way is to use the Convert Space provided by Hugging Face. The Convert Space downloads the pickled weights, converts them, and opens a Pull Request to upload the newly converted `.safetensors` file to the repository. The `.safetensors` format consists of a single JSON file containing metadata and a map of parameter names to file names, as well as standard PyTorch state dicts containing parts of the model instead of the whole one. The weights map in the JSON file maps each parameter name to the file it is stored in. After converting the weights, the model can be saved using the `save_pretrained()` function in the Transformers library, which saves both the `.safetensors` file and a `config.json` file.", "retrieved_docs": ["[[open-in-colab]]\n\n[safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) is a safe and fast file format for storing and loading tensors.

Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like `##` for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, `\"word\"` gets split like this:\n\n```\nw ##o ##r ##d\n```\n\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix.Document 2:::\n},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"WordPiece tokenizes words into subwords by finding the longest subword starting from the beginning that is in the vocabulary, then repeating the process for the rest of the text.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"Yes, this is how WordPiece proceeds for the encoding.\",\n\t\t\tcorrect: true\n\t\t},\n\t]}\n/>Document 3:::\n. ##ization as completing a word.

There are a lot of different algorithms that can be used for subword tokenization, and most models obtaining state-of-the-art results in English today use some kind of subword-tokenization algorithm.

For instance, if we use the vocabulary learned in the example above, for the word `\"hugs\"` the longest subword starting from the beginning that is inside the vocabulary is `\"hug\"`, so we split there and get `[\"hug\", \"##s\"]`.

To do this we use a *tokenizer*, which will be responsible for:\n\n- Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called *tokens*\n- Mapping each token to an integer\n- Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model", "The tokenization pipeline\n\nWhen calling `Tokenizer.encode` or\n`Tokenizer.encode_batch`, the input\ntext(s) go through the following pipeline:\n\n-   `normalization`\n-   `pre-tokenization`\n-   `model`\n-   `post-processing`\n\nWe'll see in details what happens during each of those steps in detail,\nas well as when you want to `decode <decoding>` some token ids, and how the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library allows you\nto customize each of those steps to your needs. If you're already\nfamiliar with those steps and want to learn by seeing some code, jump to\n`our BERT from scratch example <example>`.\n\nFor the examples that require a `Tokenizer` we will use the tokenizer we trained in the\n`quicktour`, which you can load with:", "{/if}\n\nIn this section we will take a closer look at the capabilities of the tokenizers in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers. Up to now we have only used them to tokenize inputs or decode IDs back into text, but tokenizers -- especially those backed by the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library -- can do a lot more. To illustrate these additional features, we will explore how to reproduce the results of the `token-classification` (that we called `ner`) and `question-answering` pipelines that we first encountered in [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1).\n\n<Youtube id=\"g8quOxoqhHQ\"/>"], "test_settings": "chunk:200_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_rerank:True_reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta", "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "The response accurately captures the essence of the purpose of tokenizers in the NLP pipeline, which is to convert text into data that can be processed by the model.

You can now easily perform inference with OpenVINO Runtime on a variety of Intel processors  ([see](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html) the full list of supported devices) using Transformers models which can be hosted either on the Hugging Face hub or locally", "```\npip install optimum[openvino]\n```\n\nStarting from the code above, we only need to replace `StableDiffusionPipeline` with `OVStableDiffusionPipeline`. To load a PyTorch model and convert it to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, you can set `export=True` when loading your model.\n\n```python\nfrom optimum.intel.openvino import OVStableDiffusionPipeline\n...\nov_pipe = OVStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True)\nlatency = elapsed_time(ov_pipe, prompt)\nprint(latency)\n\n# Don't forget to save the exported model\nov_pipe.save_pretrained(\"./openvino\")\n```", "```\npip install optimum[openvino]\n```\n\nHere, we load the model, optimize it for a static shape, and save it:\n\n```\nfrom optimum.intel.openvino import OVStableDiffusionPipeline\n\nmodel_id = \"./textual_inversion_output\"\n\nov_pipe = OVStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True)\nov_pipe.reshape(batch_size=5, height=512, width=512, num_images_per_prompt=1)\nov_pipe.save_pretrained(\"./textual_inversion_output_ov\")\n```\n\nThen, we load the optimized model, generate five different images and save them:", "## Now it's your turn\n\u200b\nAs you can see, it's pretty easy to accelerate your models with \ud83e\udd17 Optimum Intel and OpenVINO.
