Make sure you have installed `accelerate` with `pip install accelerate`.\n2. Load your model using `device_map=\"auto\"`. For example, you can use `facebook/opt-1.3b` as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-1.3b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"facebook/opt-1.3b\", device_map=\"auto\")\n```\n\n3. Use the `pipeline()` function from `transformers` to create your pipeline. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\ntext_classification_pipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-classification\", model=\"facebook/opt-1.3b\", tokenizer=\"facebook/opt-1.3b\")\n```\n\n4. Pass your input to the pipeline and run it using `accelerate`:\n\n```python\nimport accelerate\n\nwith accelerate.accelerator():\n    result = text_classification_pipeline(\"This is a sample text.\")\n    print(result[\"labels\"][0])\n```\n\nBy using `device_map=\"auto\"`, `accelerate` will automatically load the model on the appropriate devices based on its size and availability.

The context only mentions using pytesseract as an external OCR engine to obtain bounding boxes for input tokens, and then passing those bounding boxes to the LayoutLMv2Processor. The bounding boxes should be in (x0, y0, x1, y1) format, where (x0, y0) corresponds to the position of the upper left corner in the bounding box, and (x1, y1) represents the position of the lower right corner. However, it is noted that these bounding boxes need to be normalized to a 0-1000 scale before passing them to the processor. The provided code snippet demonstrates how to normalize the bounding boxes using the `box_convert` function. Therefore, it can be concluded that the bounding boxes should be formatted in (x0, y0, x1, y1) format before normalizing them, but pytesseract is not specifically mentioned in relation to this formatting. If the question is asking about formatting bounding boxes for pytesseract, then the answer would be that the context provided does not offer any guidance on how to format bounding boxes for pytesseract.",

This is mentioned in Document 0, which describes a bug fix that adds this functionality. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio import gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    bot_message = \"I'm DialoGPT. Ask me anything.\"\n    user_message = \"What's the weather like today?\"\n    bot_response = \"The weather is sunny and warm today.\"\n    bot_single_message = \"This is a single message from the bot.\"\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot([(bot_message, None), (user_message, None)])\n    bot_single_message_output = gr.Text()\n    bot_single_message_output.update(value=chatbot.send_message(bot_single_message))\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nIn this example, we first define the messages we want to send from the bot and user sides. We then create a chatbot object and add the initial messages using tuples with the message and `None` as the second value. We also create a Text component to display the output of sending a single message from the bot side. When the chatbot is launched, the user can enter their message, and the chatbot will respond as usual. To send a single message from the bot side, we call the `send_message` method of the chatbot object with the message as an argument, and the output is displayed in the Text component we created earlier.",

This format is commonly used for storing large datasets where each record is represented as a JSON object. To load a JSON Lines file into a Hugging Face Dataset, you can use the `load_dataset` function with the `json` loading script and passing the file or URL as the `data_files` argument.

Therefore, the component is flexible in accepting various file types based on the specified list. The exact filetypes accepted by the Upload component depend on the list provided by the user.

Whilst they cost a little more than the ECS approach we were using before, it’s well worth it because it saves us time on thinking about deployment, we can concentrate on the thing we want to: building NLP solutions for our clients to help solve their problems.\n\n_If you’re interested in Hugging Face Inference Endpoints for your company, please contact us [here](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/enterprise) - our team will contact you to discuss your requirements!_",

JAX uses just-in-time (jit) compilation of JAX Python functions so it can be executed efficiently in XLA. In order to get the best performance, we must use static shapes for jitted functions, this is because JAX transforms work by tracing a function and to determine its effect on inputs of a specific shape and type. When a new shape is introduced to an already compiled function, it retriggers compilation on the new shape, which can greatly reduce performance. **Note**: JIT compilation is particularly well-suited for text-to-image generation because all inputs and outputs (image input / output sizes) are static.Document 2:::\nTo take advantage of JAX's optimized speed on a TPU, pass `jit=True` to the pipeline to compile the JAX code into an efficient representation and to ensure the model runs in parallel across the 8 devices.\n\n<Tip warning={true}>\n\nYou need to ensure all your inputs have the same shape in subsequent calls, otherwise JAX will need to recompile the code which is slower.\n\n</Tip>\n\nThe first inference run takes more time because it needs to compile the code, but subsequent calls (even with different inputs) are much faster.

If we always generate the same number of images and they have the same size, then the output shapes are constant and known in advance.

Therefore, we can write JAX code that relies on fixed shapes, and that can be greatly optimized!\n\n#### High-performance throughput for high batch sizesDocument 5:::\n`jax.pmap` does two things:\n\n1.

For example, if you want to set the threshold to 0.85, you can add `--regression_threshold 0.85` to your command. This will calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient between predicted and reference scores, and consider predictions as correct if their Spearman correlation coefficient is greater than or equal to the specified threshold. This is useful for evaluating the performance of models that predict real-valued scores, such as in the case of STS-B, where the task is to predict the semantic similarity between two sentences as a real number between 0 and 1.",

First, create a `load_adapter()` function that leverages the `load_adapter()` method of `PeftModel` to load each adapter separately. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from peft import PeftModel\n\n   def load_adapter(model, adapter_path, adapter_name):\n       model.load_adapter(adapter_path, adapter_name)\n   ```\n\n2. Next, load the base model using `AutoModelForCausalLM` or any other model class. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM\n\n   base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"model_id\")\n   ```\n\n3. Load the first adapter using the `load_adapter()` function created in step 1. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   adapter_path = \"adapter1_path\"\n   adapter_name = \"adapter1\"\n   load_adapter(base_model, adapter_path, adapter_name)\n   ```\n\n4. Load the second adapter using the `load_adapter()` function again. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   adapter_path = \"adapter2_path\"\n   adapter_name = \"adapter2\"\n   load_adapter(base_model, adapter_path, adapter_name)\n\n5. Set the active adapters using the `set_adapter()` method of `PeftModel`. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   base_model.set_adapter([\"adapter1\", \"adapter2\"])\n   ```\n\n6. If you want to compare or use more than one adapter, you can also call the `add_adapter()` method of `PeftModel` to add the adapter configuration to the base model. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   adapter_path = \"adapter3_path\"\n   adapter_name = \"adapter3\"\n   base_model.add_adapter(adapter_name, adapter_path)\n   ```\n\n7.

Latent diffusion applies the diffusion process over a lower dimensional latent space to reduce memory and compute complexity. This specific type of diffusion model was proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2112.10752) by Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Björn Ommer.Document 3:::\nIf you want to apply quantization, you need the latest versions of `coremltools`, `apple/ml-stable-diffusion` and Xcode in order to do the conversion.\n* Download `coremltools` 7.0 beta from [the releases page in GitHub](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/releases).\n* Download Xcode 15.0 beta from [Apple developer site](https://developer.apple.com/).\n* Download `apple/ml-stable-diffusion` [from the repo](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion) and follow the installation instructions.\n\n</div>\n<br>Document 4:::\n![png](assets/98_stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_26_1.png)\n    \n\n## How does Stable Diffusion work?\n\nHaving seen the high-quality images that stable diffusion can produce, let's try to understand \na bit better how the model functions.\n\nStable Diffusion is based on a particular type of diffusion model called **Latent Diffusion**, proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).Document 5:::\n### Stable Diffusion v1.5\n\nStable Diffusion v1.5 is a latent diffusion model initialized from an earlier checkpoint, and further finetuned for 595K steps on 512x512 images.

[Mixed-bit quantization](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable-diffusion-xl-coreml), a new technique, can achieve 4-bit quantization (on average) with low impact on model quality.

Latent diffusion applies the diffusion process over a lower dimensional latent space to reduce memory and compute complexity. This specific type of diffusion model was proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2112.10752) by Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Björn Ommer.",

Otherwise, it will be increasingly challenging for the finance industry to leverage the latest ML advances.Document 1:::\n#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on finance?**\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence have made a profound and positive impact on finance in general and banking in particular. There are many applications in banking where many factors (features) are to be considered when making a decision and ML has traditionally helped in this respect. For example, the credit score we all universally rely on is derived from a machine learning algorithm. \n \nOver the years ML has interestingly also helped remove human bias from decisions and provided a consistent algorithmic approach to decisions. For example, in credit card/loan underwriting and mortgages, modern AI techniques can take more factors (free form text, behavioral trends, social and financial interactions) into account for decisions while also detecting fraud.Document 2:::\n#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\nThe finance and banking industry brings a lot of challenges due to the nature of the industry. First of all, it is a highly regulated industry with government oversight in many aspects. The data that is often used is very personal and identifiable data (social security numbers, bank statements, tax records, etc). Hence there is a lot of care taken to create machine learning and AI models that are private and unbiased. Many government regulations require any models to be explainable. For example, if a loan is denied, there is a fundamental need to explain why it is denied.Document 3:::\n#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on finance?**\nMachine learning (ML) has made a significant positive impact in the finance industry in many ways. For example, it has helped in combating financial crimes and identifying fraudulent transactions. Machine learning has been a crucial tool in applications such as Know Your Customer (KYC) screening and Anti Money Laundering (AML). With an increase in AML fines by financial institutions worldwide, ever changing realm of sanctions, and greater complexity in money laundering, banks are increasing their investments in KYC and AML technologies, many of which are powered by ML. ML is revolutionizing multiple facets of this sector, especially bringing huge efficiency gains by automating various processes and assisting analysts to do their jobs more efficiently and accurately.Document 4:::\n#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\n1. Reducing the False Positives without impacting the True Positives  - A number of applications using ML in the regtech space rely on alerts. With strict regulatory measures and big financial implications of a wrong decision, human investigations can be time consuming and demanding. ML certainly helps in these scenarios in assisting human analysts to arrive at the right decisions. But if a ML system results in a lot of False Positives, it makes an analysts' job harder. Coming up with the right balance is an important challenge for ML in finance.Document 5:::\n--\ntitle: \"Director of Machine Learning Insights [Part 3: Finance Edition]\"\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/78_ml_director_insights/thumbnail.png\nauthors:\n- user: britneymuller\n---\n\n# Director of Machine Learning Insights [Part 3: Finance Edition]\n\n\n_If you're interested in building ML solutions faster visit [hf.co/support](https://huggingface.co/support?utm_source=article&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ml_director_insights_3) today!_\n\n\n👋 Welcome back to our Director of ML Insights Series, Finance Edition!

What’s a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into financial applications?**\nOne of the most common mistakes people make is to use a model or a technique without understanding the underlying working principles, advantages, and shortcomings of the model. People tend to think of AI/ML models as a ‘black box’. In finance, it is especially important to understand the model and to be able to explain its’ output. Another mistake is not comprehensively testing the model on a representative input space. Model performance, validation, inference capacities, and model monitoring (retraining intervals) are all important to consider when choosing a model.\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: What is the gap between ML in basic research and education and ML in finance?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nAccording to Document 0, there is a gap between ML in basic research and education and ML in finance due to the regulated nature of the finance industry. This gap is caused by limited exchange of ideas, data, and resources between the basic research and finance sector in the area of ML. As a result, there are few exceptions, and there is scarcity of developing ML research that caters to the needs of the finance industry. This gap makes it increasingly challenging for the finance industry to leverage the latest ML advances. (Source: Document 0)",

For example, the credit score we all universally rely on is derived from a machine learning algorithm. \n \nOver the years ML has interestingly also helped remove human bias from decisions and provided a consistent algorithmic approach to decisions. For example, in credit card/loan underwriting and mortgages, modern AI techniques can take more factors (free form text, behavioral trends, social and financial interactions) into account for decisions while also detecting fraud.",
            "#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\nThe finance and banking industry brings a lot of challenges due to the nature of the industry. First of all, it is a highly regulated industry with government oversight in many aspects. The data that is often used is very personal and identifiable data (social security numbers, bank statements, tax records, etc). Hence there is a lot of care taken to create machine learning and AI models that are private and unbiased. Many government regulations require any models to be explainable. For example, if a loan is denied, there is a fundamental need to explain why it is denied.",
            "#### **1. How has ML made a positive impact on finance?**\nMachine learning (ML) has made a significant positive impact in the finance industry in many ways. For example, it has helped in combating financial crimes and identifying fraudulent transactions. Machine learning has been a crucial tool in applications such as Know Your Customer (KYC) screening and Anti Money Laundering (AML). With an increase in AML fines by financial institutions worldwide, ever changing realm of sanctions, and greater complexity in money laundering, banks are increasing their investments in KYC and AML technologies, many of which are powered by ML. ML is revolutionizing multiple facets of this sector, especially bringing huge efficiency gains by automating various processes and assisting analysts to do their jobs more efficiently and accurately.",
            "#### **2. What are the biggest ML challenges within finance?**\n1. Reducing the False Positives without impacting the True Positives  - A number of applications using ML in the regtech space rely on alerts. With strict regulatory measures and big financial implications of a wrong decision, human investigations can be time consuming and demanding. ML certainly helps in these scenarios in assisting human analysts to arrive at the right decisions. But if a ML system results in a lot of False Positives, it makes an analysts' job harder. Coming up with the right balance is an important challenge for ML in finance.",

            "#### **3. What’s a common mistake you see people make trying to integrate ML into financial applications?**\nOne of the most common mistakes people make is to use a model or a technique without understanding the underlying working principles, advantages, and shortcomings of the model. People tend to think of AI/ML models as a ‘black box’. In finance, it is especially important to understand the model and to be able to explain its’ output. Another mistake is not comprehensively testing the model on a representative input space. Model performance, validation, inference capacities, and model monitoring (retraining intervals) are all important to consider when choosing a model."

However, the effectiveness of the model in generating unique and creative responses may depend on various factors such as the input prompt, the training data, and the specific implementation details.

Import the required modules:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport timm\n```\n\n2. Create the feature backbone by passing the `features_only=True` argument to the `create_model` function of timm. This will return a model that only outputs feature maps:\n\n```python\nmodel = timm.create_model('swin_tiny', features_only=True, pretrained=True)\n```\n\n3. To specify which levels of feature maps you want to extract, you can use the `out_indices` or `out_features` argument. If you use both, ensure they are consistent. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Extract feature maps from the first and second stages\noutputs = model(inputs, output_stage=[1, 2])\n\n# Extract feature maps from the layers with names 'stem' and 'stage1'\noutputs = model(inputs, output_layers=['stem', 'stage1'])\n\n# Extract feature maps from the first and last stages\noutputs = model(inputs, output_stage=[0, -1])\n```\n\n4. Access the extracted feature maps using the `feature_maps` attribute of the `outputs` object:\n\n```python\n# Access the feature maps of the first and second stages\nfeature_maps = outputs.feature_maps\n\n# Access the feature maps of the 'stem' and 'stage1' layers\nfeature_maps = outputs[0] + outputs[1]\n```\n\n5. To visualize the stages and their feature maps, you can refer to the documentation provided in Document 4.\n\n6. To query the feature information, you can access the `.feature_info` attribute of the feature backbone:\n\n```python\n# Access the feature channels of the feature backbone\nprint(f'Feature channels: {model.feature_info.channels()}')\n```\n\n7. To load a specific model, you can follow the instructions provided in Document 6.\n\nThat's it!

It should not be truncated or only include the last line of the error message. This allows others to have the necessary context to understand the cause of the failure and potentially provide a quick fix. While it may seem tempting to provide only the last line of the error message to save space, this can actually make it harder for others to debug the issue since important information may be missing from higher up in the traceback. Therefore, it's recommended to copy and paste the whole traceback, while making sure it's nicely formatted, and to provide any additional information about what was tried to debug the issue. This will increase the likelihood of a prompt and effective response from the community.",

In most cases, this allows costly operations to be placed on GPU and significantly accelerate inference.\n\nThis guide will show you how to run inference on two execution providers that ONNX Runtime supports for NVIDIA GPUs:\n\n* `CUDAExecutionProvider`: Generic acceleration on NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs.\n* `TensorrtExecutionProvider`: Uses NVIDIA’s [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) inference engine and generally provides the best runtime performance.\n\n<Tip warning={true}>Document 5:::\n## Optimizing and quantizing in pipelines\n\nThe [`~pipelines.pipeline`] function can not only run inference on vanilla ONNX Runtime checkpoints - you can also use\ncheckpoints optimized with the [`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTQuantizer`] and the [`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTOptimizer`].\n\nBelow you can find two examples of how you could use the [`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTOptimizer`] and the\n[`~optimum.onnxruntime.ORTQuantizer`] to optimize/quantize your model and use it for inference afterwards.\n\n### Quantizing with the `ORTQuantizer`Document 6:::\n### Text-to-Image\n\nHere is an example of how you can load a SDXL ONNX model from [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0) and run inference using ONNX Runtime :\n\n```python\nfrom optimum.onnxruntime import ORTStableDiffusionXLPipeline\n\nmodel_id = \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\"\nbase = ORTStableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id)\nprompt = \"sailing ship in storm by Leonardo da Vinci\"\nimage = base(prompt).images[0]\n---\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\n\nQuestion: How can I use ONNX Runtime backend for inference?\n\n</s>\n<|assistant|>\nTo use ONNX Runtime backend for inference, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure your devices have a GPU for ONNX Runtime training, as noted in Documents 1 and 2.\n2. Install the dependencies either with the prepared Dockerfiles in Document 1 or follow the instructions in Document 2 for `torch_ort`.\n3. When running inference, add the flag `--inference_with_ort` to use ONNX Runtime backend instead of PyTorch, as noted in Documents 1 and 2.\n\nHere's an example of how to use ONNX Runtime backend for inference in Python:\n\n```python\nimport onnxruntime as ort\n\n# Load the ONNX model\nsession = ort.InferenceSession(\"model.onnx\")\n\n# Prepare input data\ninput_data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=np.float32)\n\n# Run inference using ONNX Runtime backend\noutputs = session.run(None, {\"input\": input_data})\n\n# Access the output tensor\nprint(outputs[0])\n```\n\nNote that ONNX Runtime supports different hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms, as mentioned in Document 0.

This loss function is based on the Triplet Loss, where a triplet consists of an anchor sentence, a positive sentence with the same label, and a negative sentence with a different label. The loss function aims to minimize the distance between the anchor and positive sentences while maximizing the distance between the anchor and negative sentences. This loss function is used during training to learn meaningful sentence embeddings that can be used for various downstream NLP tasks. (Source: Document 2)",

            "Case 1: Pair of sentences and a label indicating how similar they are. The loss function optimizes such that (1) the sentences with the closest labels are near in the vector space, and (2) the sentences with the farthest labels are as far as possible. The loss function depends on the format of the label. If its an integer use [`ContrastiveLoss`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/losses.html#contrastiveloss) or [`SoftmaxLoss`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/losses",

It provides most of the building blocks you can stick together to tune embeddings for your specific task.\" - [Sentence Transformers Documentation](https://www.sbert.net/docs/training/overview.html#training-overview).\n\nThis is what the training or fine-tuning looks like:",
            "Case 3: When your samples are triplets of the form `[anchor, positive, negative]` and you have an integer label for each, a loss function optimizes the model so that the anchor and positive sentences are closer together in vector space than the anchor and negative sentences. You can use [`BatchHardTripletLoss`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/losses.html#batchhardtripletloss), which requires the data to be labeled with integers (e.g., labels 1, 2, 3) assuming that samples with the same label are similar. Therefore, anchors and positives must have the same label, while negatives must have a different one",
            "Writing a loss function to capture these attributes seems intractable and most language models are still trained with a simple next token prediction loss (e.g. cross entropy).

First, you need to get the imagenet class mappings. You can do this by making a request to the URL provided and saving the response to a file. Here's an example in Python using the `urllib.request` module:\n\n   ```python\n   url, filename = (\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt\", \"imagenet_classes.txt\")\n   urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)\n   ```\n\n2. Next, open the file containing the class mappings and read its contents line by line. Store each line (which is a class name) in a list:\n\n   ```python\n   with open(\"imagenet_classes.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n       categories = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]\n   ```\n\n3. After getting the class mappings, you can use the model to make predictions on an image. Here's an example using PyTorch:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   with torch.no_grad():\n       out = model(tensor)\n   ```\n\n4. Calculate the softmax probabilities for the output tensor:\n\n   ```python\n   probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)\n   ```\n\n5. To get the top-5 predictions and their corresponding probabilities, you can use the `argsort` function to sort the probabilities in descending order and then slice the first 5 elements:\n\n   ```python\n   top_class_preds = torch.argsort(preds, descending=True)[0, :5]\n\n   for c in top_class_preds:\n       print(f\"{model.config.id2label[c.item()]} with probability {round(preds[0, c.item()].item(), 4)}\")\n   ```\n\n6. Alternatively, you can use the `torch.topk` function to find the top-5 predicted class indexes and values:\n\n   ```python\n   values, indices = torch.topk(probabilities,",

For edge-level information, you can concatenate node pair representations or do a dot product. For graph-level information, it is possible to do a global pooling (average, sum, etc.) on the concatenated tensor of all the node-level representations. Still, it will smooth and lose information over the graph -- a recursive hierarchical pooling can make more sense, or add a virtual node, connected to all other nodes in the graph, and use its representation as the overall graph representation.*\n\n### Pre-neural approaches\n\n#### Simply using engineered features",

To alleviate the collection cost of full logical forms, one popular approach focuses on weak supervision consisting of denotations instead of logical forms.

In this paper, we present TAPAS, an approach to question answering over tables without generating logical forms. TAPAS trains from weak supervision, and predicts the denotation by selecting table cells and optionally applying a corresponding aggregation operator to such selection.

When computing the Q target, we first select the best action to take for the next state using our DQN network, which is the network used for action selection. Then, we use a separate network, called the Target network, to calculate the target Q value of taking that selected action at the next state. By decoupling the action selection from the target Q value generation, Double DQN reduces the overestimation of Q values, which helps to train faster and with more stable learning. This is because the Target network provides a more accurate estimate of the Q value, as it is not influenced by the same network used for action selection, which can lead to overestimation due to the greedy policy.",
