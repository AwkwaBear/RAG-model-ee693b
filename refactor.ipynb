    "Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    "1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples)\n",
    "2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset.\n",

    "‚û°Ô∏è It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    "1. The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM ü§ñ, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs ü§ñ\n",
    "2. An [LLM-as-a-judge](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) agent ü§ñ will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.\n",

This allows us to analyze a set of documents and determine the topics they discuss, as well as the balance of topics within each document. More recently, new approaches to topic modelling have moved beyond using words to using more rich representations such as those offered through Transformer based models.  \\n\\n## What is BERTopic?\\n\\nAnswer::: \\nBERTopic is a Python library for topic modelling that uses the BERT language model to extract topics from text data. It is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple interface for generating topics from text data.\\n\\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear introduction to BERTopic, but it does not mention any new features added to it. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question unambiguously with the given context.\\n\\nTotal rating: 1</td>\n",

BERTopic now supports pushing and pulling trained topic models directly to and from the Hugging Face Hub. This new integration opens up exciting possibilities for leveraging the power of BERTopic in production use cases with ease.\\n\\n## What is Topic Modelling?\\n\\nTopic modelling is a method that can help uncover hidden themes or \"topics\" within a group of documents. By analyzing the words in the documents, we can find patterns and connections that reveal these underlying topics. For example, a document about machine learning is more likely to use words like \"gradient\" and \"embedding\" compared to a document about baking bread. \\n\\nEach document usually covers multiple topics in different proportions. By examining the word statistics, we can identify clusters of related words that represent these topics. This allows us to analyze a set of documents and determine the topics they discuss, as well as the balance of topics within each document. More recently, new approaches to topic modelling have moved beyond using words to using more rich representations such as those offered through Transformer based models.  \\n\\n## What is BERTopic?   \n",

The idea here is that we will encrypt the representation given by the transformer rather than the raw text itself. In Concrete-ML, you can do this very quickly by setting the parameter `execute_in_fhe=True` in the predict function. This is just a developer feature (mainly used to check the running time of the FHE model). We will see how we can make this work in a deployment setting a bit further down.   \n",

As we saw in [Chapter 6](/course/chapter6/4) when we explored the internals of the `question-answering` pipeline, we will deal with long contexts by creating several training features from one sample of our dataset, with a sliding window between them.\\n\\nTo see how this works using the current example, we can limit the length to 100 and use a sliding window of 50 tokens. As a reminder, we use:\\n\\n- `max_length` to set the maximum length (here 100)\\n- `truncation=\"only_second\"` to truncate the context (which is in the second position) when the question with its context is too long\\n- `stride` to set the number of overlapping tokens between two successive chunks (here 50)\\n- `return_overflowing_tokens=True` to let the tokenizer know we want the overflowing tokens\\n\\n```py\\ninputs = tokenizer(\\n    question,\\n    context,\\n    max_length=100,\\n    truncation=\"only_second\",\\n    stride=50,\\n    return_overflowing_tokens=True,\\n)\\n\\nfor ids in inputs[\"input_ids\"]:\\n    print(tokenizer.decode(ids))\\n```   \n",

It will continously be updated during the week.\\n\\n### How to combine multiple datasets into one\\n\\nCheck out [this](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/how-to-combine-local-data-files-with-an-official-dataset/4685) post.\\n\\n### How to effectively preprocess the data\\n\\n\\n### How to do efficiently load datasets with limited ram and hard drive space\\n\\nCheck out [this](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/german-asr-fine-tuning-wav2vec2/4558/8?u=patrickvonplaten) post.\\n\\n\\n### How to do hyperparameter tuning\\n\\n\\n### How to preprocess and evaluate character based languages\\n\\n\\n## Further reading material\\n\\nIt is recommended that take some time to read up on how Wav2vec2 works in theory. \\nGetting a better understanding of the theory and the inner mechanisms of the model often helps when fine-tuning the model. \\n\\n**However**, if you don't like reading blog posts/papers, don't worry - it is by no means necessary to go through the theory to fine-tune Wav2Vec2 on your language of choice.\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about the model though, here are a couple of resources that are important to better understand Wav2Vec2:\\n\\n- [Facebook's Wav2Vec2 blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-state-of-the-art-speech-recognition-through-self-supervision/)\\n- [Official Wav2Vec2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477)\\n- [Official XLSR Wav2vec2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13979.pdf)\\n- [Hugging Face Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-xlsr-wav2vec2)\\n- [How does CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) work](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/)\\n\\nIt helps to have a good understanding of the following points:\\n\\n- How was XLSR-Wav2Vec2 pretrained? -> Feature vectors were masked and had to be predicted by the model; very similar in spirit to masked language model of BERT.   \n",

If a parameter is\\ngoing to be used again in near future (less than `stage3_max_reuse_distance`) then we keep it to reduce communication\\noverhead. This is super helpful when you have activation checkpointing enabled, where we do a forward recompute and\\nbackward passes a single layer granularity and want to keep the parameter in the forward recompute till the backward\\n\\nThe following configuration values depend on the model's hidden size:\\n\\n- `reduce_bucket_size`: `hidden_size*hidden_size`\\n- `stage3_prefetch_bucket_size`: `0.9 * hidden_size * hidden_size`\\n- `stage3_param_persistence_threshold`: `10 * hidden_size`\\n\\ntherefore set these values to `auto` and the [`Trainer`] will automatically assign the recommended\\nvalues. But, of course, feel free to set these explicitly as well.\\n\\n`stage3_gather_16bit_weights_on_model_save` enables model fp16 weights consolidation when model gets saved. With large\\nmodels and multiple GPUs this is an expensive operation both in terms of memory and speed. It's currently required if\\nyou plan to resume the training. Watch out for future updates that will remove this limitation and make things more\\nflexible.\\n\\nIf you're migrating from ZeRO-2 configuration note that `allgather_partitions`, `allgather_bucket_size` and\\n`reduce_scatter` configuration parameters are not used in ZeRO-3. If you keep these in the config file they will just\\nbe ignored.\\n\\n- `sub_group_size`: `1e9`\\n\\nAnswer::: \\nEvaluation: The context provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of `stage3_max_live_parameters` in the context of a larger system, including how it interacts with other parameters and its role in reducing communication overhead. However, it does not explicitly state the purpose of `stage3_max_live_parameters` in isolation. Therefore, while the context provides useful information, it may not be sufficient to unambiguously answer the question without additional context.\\n\\nTotal rating: 3   \n",

BERTopic now supports pushing and pulling trained topic models directly to and from the Hugging Face Hub. This new integration opens up exciting possibilities for leveraging the power of BERTopic in production use cases with ease.\\n\\n## What is Topic Modelling?\\n\\nTopic modelling is a method that can help uncover hidden themes or \"topics\" within a group of documents. By analyzing the words in the documents, we can find patterns and connections that reveal these underlying topics. For example, a document about machine learning is more likely to use words like \"gradient\" and \"embedding\" compared to a document about baking bread. \\n\\nEach document usually covers multiple topics in different proportions. By examining the word statistics, we can identify clusters of related words that represent these topics. This allows us to analyze a set of documents and determine the topics they discuss, as well as the balance of topics within each document. More recently, new approaches to topic modelling have moved beyond using words to using more rich representations such as those offered through Transformer based models.  \\n\\n## What is BERTopic?\\n\\nAnswer::: \\nBERTopic is a Python library for topic modelling that uses the BERT language model to extract topics from text data. It is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple interface for generating topics from text data.\\n\\nEvaluation: The context provides a clear introduction to BERTopic, but it does not mention any new features added to it. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question unambiguously with the given context.\\n\\nTotal rating: 1   \n",
