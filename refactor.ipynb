    "This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",

    "### Evaluating RAG performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    "1. An evaluation dataset with question - answer couples (QA couples)\n",
    "2. An evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system on the above evaluation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    "1. The evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM ü§ñ, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs ü§ñ\n",
    "2. An [LLM-as-a-judge](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) agent ü§ñ will then perform the evaluation on this synthetic dataset.\n",

      "This is handled by `PerceiverClassificationDecoder`. The idea is very similar to what was done when mapping the inputs to the latent space: one uses cross-attention. But now, the latent variables will produce keys and values, and one provides a tensor of whatever shape we'd like - in this case we'll provide a tensor of shape (batch_size, 1, num_labels) which will act as queries (the authors refer to these as \"decoder queries\", because they are used in the decoder). This tensor will be randomly initialized at the beginning of training, and trained end-to-end. As one can see, one just provides a dummy sequence length dimension of 1. Note that the output of a QKV attention layer always has the same shape as the shape of the queries - hence the decoder will output a tensor of shape (batch_size, 1, num_labels).

The transformers library provides a tokenizer that handles all the preprocessing expected by the pre-trained model and can be used directly or on a list. The resulting dictionary can then be passed to the model using the unpacking operator. The model itself is a regular PyTorch nn.Module or TensorFlow tf.keras.Model that can be used as usual.

    "### 1.3. Setup critique agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions generated by the previous agent can have many flaws: we should do a quality check before validating these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus build critique agents that will rate each question on several criteria, given in [this paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2312.10003):\n",
    "- **Groundedness:** can the question be answered from the given context?\n",
    "- **Relevance:** is the question relevant to users? For instance, `\"What is the date when transformers 4.29.1 was released?\"` is not relevant for ML practicioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last failure case we've noticed is when a function is tailored for the particular setting where the question was generated, but undecipherable by itself, like `\"What is the name of the function used in this guide?\"`.\n",
    "We also build a critique agent for this criteria:\n",
    "- **Stand-alone**: is the question understandable free of any context, for someone with domain knowledge/Internet access? The opposite of this would be `What is the function used in this article?` for a question generated from a specific blog article.\n",
    "\n",
    "We systematically score functions with all these agents, and whenever the score is too low for any one of the agents, we eliminate the question from our eval dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° ___When asking the agents to output a score, we first ask them to produce its rationale. This will help us verify scores, but most importantly, asking it to first output rationale gives the model more tokens to think and elaborate an answer before summarizing it into a single score token.___\n",
    "\n",
    "We now build and run these critique agents."
